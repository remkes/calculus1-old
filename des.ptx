    <title>Interpreting the Population Regression</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="section-population-growth" />, I wondered about
      the connection between percentage growth to exponential
      functions. Percentage growth is a growth rate, but that's not
      something I have a good mathematical understanding of <mdash />
      at least not yet.  Algebraic techniques have a hard time
      understanding growth rates, or rates of change in general. 
      Calculus includes a tool called the <term>derivative</term>
      of a function which measures its rate of change. For now, I
      am going to avoid the technical definition but work with the
      idea. 
      <blockquote>
        A derivative of a function is a measure of its <em>rate of
        change</em> or it <em>growth rate</em>.
      </blockquote>
      I need some notation. For a function <m>p(t)</m>, there are two
      common ways of writing the derivative.
      <md>
        <mrow> 
          \amp p^\prime(t) \amp \amp \frac{dp}{dt}
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first notation is called Newton's notation, and the second is
      called Leibniz's notation. I will use both in this course but I
      will rely on Leibniz's notation most of the time. Leibniz's
      notation has the advantage of including the independent variable
      (here <m>t</m>) in the notation; this is often very convenient,
      even though the notation is less succinct. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The derivative is the rate of change of the function, so for a
      population model, <m>\frac{dp}{dt}</m> is the growth rate of the
      population. Let me remind you of that data used in the
      <xref ref="section-population-growth" />.

      The average annual increase in the data is somewhere near
      <m>20</m>% growth. That means that the growth rate (the amount
      of population added in a year) is <m>\frac{20}{100}</m> (or
      <m>\frac{1}{5}</m>) times the current population. I can express
      this as an equation.
      <me>
        \frac{dp}{dt} = \frac{1}{5} p(t)
      </me>

      This is a mathematical translation of the understanding of
      percentage growth. An equation of this form, involving a function
      and its derivative, is called a <term>differential
      equation</term> (a DE, in short). Very often in applied
      mathematics, it is easier to observe the rate of change of a
      function than the function itself. This leads to models
      expressed as differential equations.  Many of the most important
      mathematical models are expressed as differential equations.

      The regression provided the function <m>p(t) =
      2^{\frac{t}{4}}</m>. I will show, later in the course, that the
      solution to this differential equation is a very similar
      function.
      <me>
        p(t) = e^{\frac{1}{5} t}

    <title>The Concept of a Differential Equation</title>
    <p>
      Solving differential equations is one of the major goals of
      calculus. The solution described above leads to the profound
      connection between percentage growth rate and exponential growth:
      if I observe a percentage growth rate, then the quantities I 
      observe should be described by an exponential function. This is
      how I know that many populations grow exponentially, as do
      functions involving resource use, radioactive decay, heat
      dissipation, debt repayment and investment interest. The
      importance of the exponential function lies in its use as a
      solution to a differential equation that covers this wide
      variety of real world situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      DEs provide a different approach to fiting a function to data.
      Instead of just using intuition to choose a class of functions and
      regression to get the specific function, I can look at the growth
      rates of the function in the data. If I can make a consistent
      observation about the growth rates, such as the observation that
      they grow by a consistent percentage, I can write that
      observation as a differential equation. I can then (hopefully)
      solve the differential equation to find the appropriate function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before worring about solving DEs, I simply want to understand
      what they say. The goal is essentially translation: a
      differential equation is a mathematical translation of a statement
      about the growth rate of a quantity. I want to be able to pass
      both ways between the equation and the associated statement. The
      example in this section already shows percentage growth with
      percentage <m>c</m>% translates into an equation.
      <me>
        \frac{dp}{dt} = \frac{c}{100} p
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      I can use this example to translate similar sentences as well.
      Percentage decay says that a quantity looses a
      percentage <m>c</m>% of the current value  per unit time. This
      translates into a DE with a negative growth rate.
      <me>
        \frac{dp}{dt} = -\frac{c}{100} p
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Not all differential equations are percentage growth. Perhaps the
      rate of change of some quantity is proportional to the square of
      the current value. That could likewise be translated into a DE.
      <me>
        \frac{dp}{dt} = c(p(t))^2
      </me>
    </p>

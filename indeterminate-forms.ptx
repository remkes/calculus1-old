    <title>Classifying Types of Limits</title>
    <p>
      Recall that a limit is called an <em>indeterminate form</em> if
      it cannot be evaluated or logically determined. We can classify
      indeterminate forms by their type. For now, we look at three
      types. The first two types involve quotient limits.
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> approach <m>\pm \infty</m>, the
      limit is called an indeterminate form of type
      <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m>. If instead both <m>f(x)</m> and
      <m>g(x)</m> approach <m>0</m>, then it is an indeterminate form
      of type <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>. In both cases, we want to use
      algebra to factor out and cancel off the pieces of the quotients
      which tends to <m>\infty</m> or <m>0</m> to solve the limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third type involves a difference limit.
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) - g(x)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      If both <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> approach <m>\pm \infty</m>,
      this limit is called an indeterminate form of type <m>\infty -
      \infty</m>. For this type, we want to use common denominator,
      conjugates or other algegraic tricks to reduce it to a limit of
      type <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m> or type <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all these definitions, we could replace <m>x \rightarrow
      a</m> with the one-sided limit or <m>x \rightarrow \pm
      \infty</m>; the indeterminate forms are classified the same way
      for any type of limit.

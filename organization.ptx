  <title>Organization of the Course</title>
  <p>
    These are course notes and materials for a blended or online
    Calculus 1 course. The course, and hence these materials, are
    organized into 12 weeks of content following a typical 3 month
    Canadian academic term (with an additional Week 0 for organization
    and Week 13 for review). Each chapter (week) of the notes includes
    several sections of content as well as activities and an
    assignment.

  <p>
    These notes are not meant to stand alone; instead, they are
    designed to be the written reference material for a set of videos.
    The notes are short on examples, since many of the examples are
    presented in the videos. The main purpose of the notes is to be a
    sets of explanations and references which are easier to use than
    the videos. 
  </p>
  <p>
    For each week of the course, you are expected to watch the videos
    for the week and do the activities and assignmnets presented in
    this notes. In the activities, material labelled ``Extra
    Practice'' or ``Challenge Problems' is optional material.

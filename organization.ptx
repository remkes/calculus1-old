  <title>Organization of the Course</title>
  <p>
    This calculus courses has a slightly unconventional method of
    organization. We are using a teaching model called the
    <sq>Flipped Classroom</sq>. In this model, the majority of the
    information will be delivered outside of class time through two
    avenues: these notes and a series of short videos. You will be
    required to watch one of the short videos before most lecture
    periods. These videos will deliver the main content of the
    course. We will begin each lecture period assuming you have
    watched the required video.
  </p>
  <p>
    The videos are used to introduce the main topics of the course.
    They are the explanation. Along with each video and lecture
    period, there will be a short section of notes. The notes are
    provided for reference, so that after you've watched the video,
    you can use the notes to remind yourself of the content and refer
    to useful ideas, concepts and formulae. The notes are not
    primarily written to explain the material; instead, they are
    written to provide a record of the ideas in the video for your
    reference. The notes are light on examples. The lecture time
    will be mostly devoted to necessary practice and examples.
  </p>
  <p>
    The course is organized into 30 lectures; the videos and the
    activities are numbered to match these lectures. There is a
    detailed schedule on the course website showing when the various
    lectures happen over the term. Please use this schedule to ensure
    you watch the appropriate videos before class and bring the
    appropriate sections of the notes.

    <title>Autonomous DEs</title>
    <p>
      At this point in the course, I lack the tools to solve
      differential equations. Instead, I want to present some qualitative
      analysis of the differential equation. I'm going to consider a
      restrictive type of DE. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A differential equation where the left-side is just
          <m>\frac{dp}{dt}</m> and the right-side is some algebraic
          expression in <m>p</m> is called an <em>autonomous differential
          equation</em>. (The independent variable <m>t</m> cannot
          appear in this expression on fhte left-side.) 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Many natural models are described by autonomous equations,
      including  population growth. There is a lovely piece of
      analysis for autonomous equations called the <em>phase line
      analysis</em>. It leads to a solid understanding of the
      behaviour of the model without actually having to solve the DE
      at all.

    <title>Phase Line Analysis</title>
    <p>
      Phase line analysis looks at the right side of an autonomous
      differential equation and asks for values of <m>p</m> which set
      the right side to zero. What does this mean? When the right side
      of the differential equation is zero, the left side is zero as
      well.  The left side is the growth rate, so that means the
      growth rate is (momentarily) zero. Therefore, these values of
      <m>p</m> are values of the population where there is no growth.
      We call these values <em>steady states</em> of the population.
      If the population is exactly at its steady state, it will not
      change; steady states are constant popluations which do no grow
      or decline.
    <p>
    </p>
      Once I have the steady states, I investigate what happens
      between each steady state. Between the steady states, the right
      side will be either positive or negative. When it is positive,
      the left side is also positive, so the population has a positive
      growth rate and will increase.  When it is negative, the left
      side is also negative, so the population has a negative growth
      rate and will decrease.  This direction of growth, negative or
      positive, is called the <em>trajectory</em> of the popluation
      between the steady states.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amazingly, this gives us an impressively complete understanding
      of the population.
      <ol>
        <li>
          If the popluation is at a steady state, it doesn't change.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the popluation is not at a steady state, I look at the
          trajectory.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the trajectory is positive, the popluation grows
          approaching either the closest larger steady state or
          infinity.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the trajectory is neagative, the population declines
          approaching either the closest smaller steady state or zero.
        </li>
      </ol>
      A <em>phase line diagram</em> is a visual summary of this
      information. It consists of a real number line, representing the
      function. (For populations, of course, negative values are
      excluded). Dots are placed on the phase line to indicate the
      steady states.  In between the steady states, arrows are drawn
      to show the trajectories. Its best to see the phase line
      diagrams through examples.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <me>
          \frac{dp}{dx} = p^2 - p
          </me>
          The right side is zero when <m>p=0</m> or <m>p=1</m>, so
          those are the steady states. When <m>p \in (0,1)</m> the
          right-side is negative, so the trajectory is decreasing.
          When <m>p \in (1, \infty)</m>, the right-side is positive,
          so the trajectory is increasing. This phase line encodes
          this information.

          The logistic equation leads to logistic growth. Logistic
          growth is identified by the fact that the two trajectories
          point towards the steady state <m>p=4</m>. In logistic
          growth, the population wants to approach to some non-zero
          steady state. From below, this is growth up to some maximum
          and from above it is decay down to a minimum. (After
          exponential growth, logistic growth is the most commonly
          used model for populations.) <xref
          ref="figure-exponential-logistic" /> shows both exponential
          and logistic growth (where the steady state for the logistic
          model is at <m>p=6</m>.)

          The right side factors as <m>p(p-2)(p-5)</m>, so it is zero
          when <m>p=0</m>, <m>p=2</m> or <m>p=5</m>. Those are the
          steady states. When <m>p \in (0,2)</m> the right-side is
          positive, so the trajectory is increasing. When <m>p \in
          (2,5)</m>, the right-side is negative, so the trajectory is
          decreasing. When <m>p \in (5,\infty)</m>, the right-side is
          positive, so the trajectory is increasing.

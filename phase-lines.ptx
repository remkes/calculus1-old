    <title>Autonomous DEs</title>
    <p>
      At this point in the course, we lack the tools to solve
      differential equations. Instead, we want to do some qualitative
      analysis of the differential equation. We will restrict this
      analysis to a particular type. 
      <definition>
        <statement>
          A differential equation where the left-side is just
          <m>\frac{dp}{dt}</m> and the right-side is some algebraic
          expression in <m>p</m> is called an \emph{autonomous differential
          equation}.
        </statement>
      </definition>
      Many natural models are described by autonomous equations,
      including  population growth. There is a lovely piece of
      analysis for autonomous equations called the <em>phase line
      analysis</em>.

    <title>Phase Line Analysis</title>
    <p>
      Phase line analysis looks at the right side of the equation and
      asks for values of the function <m>p</m> which set the right
      side to zero. What does this mean? When the right side of our
      differential equation is zero, so the left side is zero as well.
      The left side is the growth rate, so that means the growth rate
      is (momentarily) zero. These are values of the population
      <m>p</m> where there is no growth. We call these values
      <em>steady states</em> of the population. If the population is
      exactly at its steady state, it will not change; steady states
      are constant popluations which do no grow or decline. For
      population models, we can make the reasonable assumptions that
      <m>p \geq 0</m> and <m>p=0</m> is always a steady state.
    <p>
    </p>
      Once we have the steady states, we ask what happens between each
      steady state. Assuming that the DE is reasonable, then between
      the steady states, the right side will be either positive or
      negative. When it is positive, we have a positive growth rate
      and the population increases.  When it is negative, we have a
      negative growth rate and the population decreases. This
      direction of growth, negative or positive, is called the
      <em>trajectory</em> of the popluation between the steady states.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amazingly, this gives us an impressively complete understanding
      of the population.
      <ol>
        <li>
          If the popluation is at a steady state, it doesn't change.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the popluation is not at a steady state, we look at the
          trajectory.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the trajectory is positive, the popluation grows to the
          closest larger steady state or infinity.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the trajectory is neagative, the population declines to
          the closest smaller steady state or zero.
        </li>
      </ol>
      We summarize this information is a phase line diagram. We take a
      ray representing <m>p \geq 0</m> and put dots on the ray for the
      steady states. In between, we put arrows to show the
      trajectories. Its best to see the phase line diagrams through
      examples.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <me>
          \frac{dp}{dx} = p^2 - p
          </me>
          The right side is zero when <m>p=0</m> or <m>p=1</m>, so
          those are the steady states. When <m>p \in (0,1)</m> the
          derivative is negative, so the trajectory is decreasing.
          When <m>p \in (1, \infty)</m>, the derivative is positive,
          so the trajectory is increasing. This phase line encodes
          this information.

          The logistic equation leads to logistic growth. We can see
          from the that the trajectories all point towards the steady
          state <m>p=4</m>. In logistic growth, the population wants
          to approach to some non-zero steady state. From below, this
          is growth up to some maximum and from above it is decay down
          to a minimum. (After exponential growth, logistic growth is
          the most commonly used model for populations.) <xref
          ref="figure-exponential-logistic" /> shows both exponential
          and logistic growth (where the steady state for the logistic
          model is at <m>p=6</m>.)

          The right side factors as <m>p(p-2)(p-5)</m>, so it is zero
          then <m>p=0</m>, <m>p=2</m> or <m>p=5</m>. Those are the
          steady states. When <m>p \in (0,2)</m> the derivative is
          positive, so the trajectory is increasing. When <m>p \in
          (2,5)</m>, the derivative is negative, so the trajectory is
          decreasing. When <m>p \in (5,\infty)</m>, the derivative is
          positive, so the trajectory is increasing.

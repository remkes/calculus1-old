    <title>Composition</title>
    <p>
      A more novel way to combine function is <em>composition</em>.
      In pointwise operations, both the functions act seperately on
      the input and then we combine the result. In composition, we
      let one function act first and then let the second act on the
      output of the first. If <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are functions, we
      write <m>f \circ g</m> or <m>f(g(x))</m> for their composition.
      In this notation, somewhat counterintuitively, the function on
      the right acts first. <m>f \circ g</m> means we let the
      function <m>g</m> act first and then let the function <m>f</m>
      act second. Additional domain restrictions may result from
      composition, since the output of <m>g</m> must be acceptable
      input for the function <m>f</m>. In <m>f \circ g</m>, we call
      <m>g</m> the <em>inside function</em> and <m>f</m> the
      <em>outside function</em>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f(x) = e^x</m> and <m>g(x) = x^2+1</m>, then <m>f
          \circ g (x) = e^{x^2+1}</m> and <m>g \circ f = (e^x)^2
          +1</m>.

          Often is it important to recognize a composed functions and
          identify the pieces of the composition. The function
          <m>h(x) = \sqrt{x+7}</m> is a composition with inside
          function <m>g(x) = x+7</m> and outside function <m>f(x) =
          \sqrt{x}</m>. For complicated functions, there may be
          several ways to decompose the function as a composition;
          finding various decompositions and knowing which composition
          to use is an important skill.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Composition can be iterated. If <m>f</m>, <m>g</m> and <m>h</m>
      are functions, <m>f \circ g \circ h(x)</m> is the composition of
      all three, with <m>h</m> acting first, <m>g</m> second and
      <m>f</m> third.

    <title>Inversion</title>
    <p>
      The last important operation on functions is inversion.
      Inversion attempts to undo what a function has accomplished, to
      go backwards and return the output to the original input. If
      <m>f(x)</m> is a function, we write <m>f^{-1}(x)</m> for its
      inverse. This notation <em>does not</em> mean the reciprocal
      function <m>\frac{1}{f(x)}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order for a function to be invertible, each output needs to
      go back to a unique input. This restrictions implies that no
      two inputs can be sent to the same output. This property is
      called <em>injectivity</em>, but for our purposes, it is enough
      that a function is <em>monotonic</em>. A function which always
      increases or decreases can only have one input sent to any
      particular output; therefore, it is invertible. When we want to
      invert a function, we must make sure that it is monotonic.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we compose a function and its inverse, we get the original
      input back. That is <m>f \circ f^{-1}(x) = x</m> and <m>f^{-1}
      \circ f(x) = x</m> on the approriate domains. This is very
      useful for manipulating equations, since we can remove any
      function by compositing with its inverse.
    </p>

          We use the natural logarithm to remove the exponential with
          base <m>e</m>.

              \ln e^x \amp  = \ln y

            <mrow>
              x \amp  = \ln y

          Likewise, we use inverse trig to remove trig function.

            <mrow>
              \sin x \amp  = y
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \arcsin (\sin x) \amp = \arcsin y
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              x \amp  = \arcsin y
            </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

      For a monotonic function, the domain of the inverse will be the
      range of the original function. If we can calculate the range
      of the original function, we get the domain of the inverse for
      free. In the first example above, the range of <m>e^x</m> is
      <m>(0,\infty)</m>, so that becomes the domain of <m>\ln x</m>.
      In the second second above, <m>\sin x</m> is not monotonic on
      its whole domain, so we have to make an adjustment before we can
      understand the range.

    <p>
      Many functions are not monotonic, but we would like to invert
      them anyway. We solve this problem by restricting the domain.
      The classic example is the quadratic <m>f(x) = x^2</m>. This
      function has a domain of <m>\RR</m>, but it is not invertible,
      since both <m>x</m> and <m>-x</m> are sent to <m>x^2</m>. Going
      backwards, we do not know whether to sent <m>x^2</m> to <m>x</m>
      or <m>-x</m>. Therefore, we restrict the domain. The function
      <m>f(x) = x^2</m> on the restricted domain <m>[0, \infty)</m> is
      increasing, therefore it is invertible. Its inverse is
      <m>f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{x}</m>, returning the positive square root.
    </p>
    <p>
      The example of <m>\sin x</m> we used above is desperately not
      monotonic: it isolates up and down constantly. We have to make
      a severe restriction to invert it, by choosing a very small
      piece where it is monotonic. For <m>\sin x</m>, the
      conventional choice is the interval <m>\left[ \frac{-\pi}{2},
      \frac{\pi}{2} \right]</m>, where <m>\sin x</m> is an increasing
      function. On this interval, the range of <m>\sin x</m> is
      <m>[-1,1]</m>, so the domain of <m>\arcsin x</m> is also
      <m>[-1,1]</m>.

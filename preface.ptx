    These are course notes and materials for a blended or online
    Calculus 1 course. The course, and hence these materials, are
    organized into 12 weeks of content following a typical 3 month
    Canadian academic term (with an additional Week 0 for organization
    and Week 13 for review). Each chapter (week) of the notes includes
    several sections of content as well as activities and an
    assignment. 
  </p>
  <p>
    These notes are not meant to stand alone; instead, they are
    designed to be the written reference material for a set of videos.
    The notes are short on examples, since many of the examples are
    presented in the videos. The main purpose of the notes is to be a
    sets of explanations and references which are easier to use than
    the videos. 
  </p>
  <p>
    For each week of the course, you are expected to watch the videos
    for the week and do the activities and assignmnets presented in
    this notes. In the activities, material labelled ``Extra
    Practice'' or ``Challenge Problems' is optional material.

  <title>Other Resources</title>
  <p>
    In addition to the notes associated to each lecture, there are a
    number of other resources which are distributed via the course
    Moodle site. These resources have been developed to assist you,
    so please make use of them.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A set of pre-calculus notes and learning modules
          (hopefully!). If you struggled with the self-assessment or
          are otherwise worried about your background mathematical
          knowledge and skills, these resources are here to help you
          learn or practice skills which are prerequisite to this
          course.

          A complete formula sheet. All of the basic formulas and
          rules for calculation are included on this sheet. There are
          sections on algebra, trigonometry, derivatives and
          integrals.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A library of functions. This reference gives archetypical
          examples of all of the elementary functions that we use in
          calculus. There are also small example graphs, so that you
          can develop a visual intuition for common functions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A notation reference. Though many of the idea in the course
          have been covered in high-school mathematics, often our
          notations differ. This reference covers a number of
          notations used in the course which may be unfamiliar.
        </p>
      </li>

          A course outcomes sheet. This was originally developed as a
          study aid for students. It summarizes the main definitions
          and concepts of the course, as well as the types of
          questions your will encounter on assignments and exams.  In
          particular, it gives a guide to the material on the exam.
          If you want to know whether a definition, topic or type of
          problem might show up on the exam, consult this sheet.
          There will be nothing on the exam that isn't referenced on
          this sheet.

  <title>Perspectives and Philosophy</title>
  <p>
    In addition to the strictly mathematical material of the course, I
    will try to share some ideas about the philosophy of mathematics,
    the aesthetics of mathematics, and how our own worldview and
    assumptions influence mathematical thought. As several spots in
    the course, I will include short videos on these topics. I will
    ask you to write some reflections on these short videos.

<p>We can ask three questions.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">First, when do we have maximum net benefit?  That is, when is the difference \(B(x) - C(x)\) maximized?  The derivative must be zero, so \(B^\prime(x) - C^\prime(x) =
0\text{,}\) which is \(B^\prime(x) = C^\prime(x)\text{.}\) We optimize net benefit when the marginal costs are equal. After finding such a point, we will still have to investigate to see if the point is a minimum, maximum or neither.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The second question is a local variant of the first question. If we are currently at a production rate of \(x_0\) units, would more production increase the net benefit?  That is, is the net benefit currently an increasing function?  Increasing means positive derivative, so we look for \(B^\prime(x) - C^\prime(x) &gt;
0\text{,}\) which is \(B^\prime(x) &gt; C^\prime(x)\text{.}\) Increasing production increases the net benefit if the marginal benefit is larger than the marginal cost. This leads to a reasonable interpretation of these derivatives: marginal cost is (roughly) the cost to produce <em class="emphasis">the next</em> unit, and marginal benefit is the benefit due to <em class="emphasis">the next</em> unit. We can increase net benefit if the next unit has greater benefit than cost.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Lastly, we can ask a different strategic question. Instead of maximizing net benefit (like profit for a company), what if our motivation is just maximum benefit while still breaking even (more like a non-profit). This is still an optimization question, but with a different approach. Now we want to break even, which mathematically is \(B(x) = C(x)\text{.}\) The derivatives no longer come into play; we just have to solve this equality of functions and find the solution \(x\) with the highest gross benefit.</p></li>

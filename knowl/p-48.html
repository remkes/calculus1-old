<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">One of the major motivating problems for conics and analytic geometry is the problem of celestial motion â€” how planets, moons, stars, comets and other celestial objects move and orbit around each other. The Greeks assumed, erroneously, that orbits ought to be perfect circles. Johannes Kepler, in the 16th century, correctly observed that orbits take non-circular shapes. He put forward a very convincing theory that orbits have shapes which are conics with the larger object fixed at one of the foci of the conic. This leads to ellipses for objects without escape velocity and hyperbolas for those with escape velocity. Though not perfect (particularly in complicated multi-body problems or when relativistic corrections are included), Kepler's model is remarkably accurate. Conics are still used as the basic models of orbital paths.</p>

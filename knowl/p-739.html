<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">This certainly isn't an exhaustive list of all possible questions; strategically, there could be many considerations leading to many questions. Perhaps we have a fixed budget, so the cost \(C(x)\) cannot, under any circumstances, cross a fixed maximum. If our product is a service, our goal might be maximum usage instead of maximum net benefit. Perhaps we need to minimize average cost of production instead of net benefit. Whenever we use mathematics for strategic reasons in a applied situation, it is important to remember that the mathematics only answers the questions we asked. It doesn't tell us which question we actually want to ask, nor how to compare between the various questions.</p>

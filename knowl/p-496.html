<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">As with most of the fundanmental equations of physics, Newtonian motion is determined by the solution of a differential equation. Let's take a more specific example. On the surface of the earth, it is assumed that the acceleration due to gravity is constant at rougly \(9.8 m/s^2\text{.}\) We can observe that the flight of projectiles is roughly parabolic, that is, height is described by a parabola \(h(t) = at^2 + bt + c\text{.}\) If we differentiate once, vertical velocity is \(h^\prime(t) = 2at + b\text{.}\) If we differentiate twice, vertical acceleration is \(h^{\prime
\prime}(t) = 2a\text{,}\) which is constant. So parabolic paths fit with the notion of a constant acceleration due to gravity. Even more, we know that the leading coefficient of those quadratics should be roughly \(a = 4.9\) to get the constant acceleration \(2a = 9.8m/s^2\text{.}\)</p>

<body><article class="example example-like"><p>Consider a model of temperature in a chemical reaction where \(T\) is in degree celcius and \(t\) is in minutes. This model is given by a differential equation. This is a relatively common situation: often in our observations of the world, we can observe a differential equation instead of directly observing the function.</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dT}{dt} = 6-3t
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>For this differential equation, we can just integrate to solve. That gives the function \(T = -3t^2 + 6t + c\text{.}\) To specify the function completely, we would need an initial temperature. Let's say that initial temperature is 12 degrees: \(T = -3t^2 + 6t + 12\)</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">This is a downward quadratic. If we complete the square, we get the vertex form: \(T= -3(t^2 - 2t + 1) +
15 = -3 (t-1)^2 + 15\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Therefore, we have a maximum at \(t=1\) minutes. That maximum is \(T(1) = 15\) degrees. The function rises in temperature of a minute, then start to drop in a parabolic shape.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The starting temperature, as given, is \(T(0) = 12\) degrees.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The long term behaviour is \(T \rightarrow -\infty\text{.}\) However, this is obviously unreasonable. First, mostly likely there is an ambient temperature which the system will eventually reduce to. Second, even if this is happening in the vacuum of space, temperature is still bounded below at \(-273\) degrees. We conclude that this model is only meant to operate for relatively small \(t\text{.}\)</p></li>

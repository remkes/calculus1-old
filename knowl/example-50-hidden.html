<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
r(t) = \begin{cases} 3 + \frac{5t^2}{10000} \amp t \leq 100
\\ 2^{(-\frac{t}{100} + 4)} \amp t &gt; 100 \end{cases} 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The domain of the model is \(t \geq 0\text{,}\) showing that we start observing at year 0. The starting value at year 0 is \(r(0) = 3\) grays.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The function is piecewise, but we can check that it is continuous at its cross-over point.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">There are no vertical asymptotes. The limit at \(\infty\) is 0, so \(y=0\) is a horizontal asymptote. That means the long term behaviour is a decay to negligable radiation.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Derivative is positive on the first section \((0 \leq t
\leq 100)\) and negative on the second section \((t &gt;
100)\text{.}\) Therefore, we expect a maximum at \(t=100\text{.}\) The radioactivity of the site is increasing for 100 years and decreasing at all times afterward.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">If safe level of radioactivity are under \(5\) grays, we can ask when the site is safe. To do so, we simply solve \(r(t) = 5\text{.}\) In approximate values, the site become unsafe at \(t = 63.2\) years and becomes safe again after \(t = 167.8\) years.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">As a narrative, qualitative summary, it looks like there is contamination that slowly increases the radioactivity over the first 100 years. At 100 years, something suddenly changes: either the contamination source is removed or some kind of cleaning process exists that removes contamination faster than it is added. From that point on, contamination decays, eventually dropping to near-zero levels.</p></li>

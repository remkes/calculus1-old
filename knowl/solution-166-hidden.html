<p>We have a possile maximum net benefit when the marginal cost and marginal benefit are equal. We calculate those two and set them equal to each other. We need to work with two pieces, one for \(x \leq 2\) and another for \(x \gt
2\text{.}\) We will start with \(x \leq 2\text{.}\)</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dx} C(x) \amp = \frac{x^2}{3} \\
\frac{d}{dx} B(x) \amp = 4\\
\frac{x^2}{3} \amp = 4 \\
x^2 \amp = 12 \\
x \amp \dot 3.46
\end{align*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">This solution is not in the range \(x \leq 2\text{,}\) so there are no critical points on this part of the domain. For all of this part of the domain, the marginal cost is bounded by \(\frac{4}{3}\text{,}\) which is always smaller than the marginal benefit, so the net benefit is always increasing. Now let's consider \(x \gt 2\text{.}\)</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dx} C(x) \amp = \frac{x^2}{3}\\
\frac{d}{dx} B(x) \amp = 0
\end{align*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">These can never be equal and the marginal cost is always larger than the marginal benefit. We don't have a critical point and the net benefit is always decreasing.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Even though we don't have a critical point, we have an understandable situation. Before \(x=2\text{,}\) the net benefit is increasing and after \(x=2\text{,}\) the net benefit is decreasing. Therefore, we have the maximum net benefit at the cross-over point, when \(x=2\text{.}\)</p>
<p>For the break even point, we set the two functions each to each other and solve. Again, we work in two pieces, first taking \(x \leq 2\text{.}\)</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
C(x) \amp = B(x) \\
\frac{1}{9}x^3 \amp = 4x \\
x^2 \amp = 36 \\
x \amp = 6
\end{align*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">This point isn't in this section of the domain, so it is not a break even point. We also have \(x=0\) that satisfies this equality, but that isn't an interesting break even point. Now let's take \(x \gt 2\text{.}\)</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
C(x) \amp = B(x) \\
\frac{1}{9}x^3 \amp = 8\\
x^3 \amp = 72\\
x \amp = \sqrt[3]{72} \doteq 4.16
\end{align*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">We have a break even point. It is the only (non-zero) break even point and the benefit is always positive, so it must be the largest break even point.  <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/figure-marginal-3.html" title="Figure 11.4.3">FigureÂ 11.4.3</a> shows the behaviour of this marginal analysis model. <figure class="figure figure-like"><div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="images/figure78.svg" role="img" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt=""></div>

The piecewise benefit function is more interesting. For the first while, benefit is linear, meaning that each unit produces the same benefit. However, the benefit suddenly becomes flat, showing that after a period of time, the demand is suddenly zero and no more benefit can be produces. In this case, the break-even analysis isn't very useful, since we are already at the highest benefit value much ealier.</p>

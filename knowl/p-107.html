<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The number \(n\) of the largest power in the polynomial is called the <em class="emphasis">degree</em> of the polynomial. The previous cases are all polynomials: constant functions have degree zero, linear functions have degree one, and quadratics have degree two. We have names for the next few degress as well: cubics have degree three, quartics have degree four and quintics have degree five. Polynomial functions have a familiar standard shape involving a graph that curves up a down some number of times. The maximum number of times the graph of polynomial can change directions is one less than the degree. Polynomials of degree \(n\) can have at most \(n\) roots, though they may have fewer. Polynomial functions have no domain restrictions.</p>

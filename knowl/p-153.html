<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The analysis of models thus consists of everything we used to analyze functions in <a href="section-functions.html" class="internal" title="Section 2.1: Functions">Section 2.1</a> and <a href="section-operations-on-functions.html" class="internal" title="Section 2.4: Operations on Functions">Section 2.4</a> as well as these new questions. Often we will want a qualitative analysis of the model. Understanding the general shape and behaviour of the functions involved is invaluable to this qualitative analysis. A major goal for this course is to develop tools and competencies to allow students to analyze functions and models both quantitatively and qualitatively. The qualitative analysis can often be expressed in a narrative: what story is the function telling about the relationship? If the independant variable is time, as it often is, what is the story of the dependant variable over a time span?  What happens to it?</p>

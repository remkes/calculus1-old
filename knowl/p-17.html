<p>Lines and conics are just two of many classes and families of loci in \(\RR^2\text{.}\) Here are some others.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">A curve in \(\RR^2\text{:}\) While curves include lines and conics, the term ‘curve’ is a general term for curving paths. Many equations give rise to complicated curves, which can be very unpredicable. Future calculus courses will study the calculus of curves.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Instead of lines, we can restrict to portions of lines. For example, the piece of the line \(y=x\) that has only positive \(x\) coordinates is the ray pointing out from the origin at an angle of \(\pi/4\) radians. By taking finite pieces, we get line segments.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">With line segments, we can form straight-edged objects such as polygons. They are also loci not defined by one particular equation, but by the equations of several lines and restriction of those lines.</p></li>

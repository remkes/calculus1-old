<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Analytic geometry was a huge breakthrough for mathematics. Prior to the 17th century, algebra and geometry were haphazardly connected branches of mathematics. Various attempts had been made to give algebraic descriptions to geometric objects (including some primitive versions of cartesian coordinates long before Descartes), but none of these ideas and systems had managed to give a systematic and thorough connection. In the 17th century, Descartes proposed the coordinate system which now bears his name: the cartesian coordinates. Assigning numerical values to points in the plane (2 dimensional) or space (3 dimensional) allowed geometric problems to be interpreted algebraically, and vice-versa. Moreover, this connection was complete and systematic: in theory, any geometry in the plane or space could be described by Descartes' coordinates. This breakthrough was fundamental to the use of mathematics in the sciences, starting in the early modern age and continuing into the present. Cartesian coordinates must be numbered among a very short list of the most important mathematical advances in history.</p>

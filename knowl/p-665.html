<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">This look very similar to the previous question. One might thing that the process should be exactly the same. You could follow that process and get an answer, but that answer would not be valid. The problem, here, is that this is a definite integral, which calculates an area under the curve. Given these bounds, we are looking for the area between 0 and 4. However, this function is undefined at \(x=3\text{,}\) where it has a vertical asymptote. Therefore, the notion of area under this curve is meaningless. There is no connected curve under which we can define an area. This integral has no answer.</p>

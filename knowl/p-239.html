<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We have already encounted these kinds of limit: in the calculation of limits, the first step was to try to evaluate the function at the limit point. We were implicitly relying on the continuity of our standard functions. Happily, we were justified in doing so: all the standard elementary functions (polynomials, rational function, algebraic functions, trig, exponentials) are continuous on their domains. The phrase ‘on their domains’ is important; where there is a break in the domain, the function cannot be continuous. Continuity only happens inside the domain of a function. Visually, the graph of a continuous function is connected; it can be drawn without lifting your pen (pencil, chalk, etc).</p>

<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Many applications of optmization are found in geometry, both for purely mathematics and very practical reasons. As shown in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/figure-distance-between-points.html" title="Figure 11.2.3">FigureÂ 11.2.3</a>, the distance between two points \((a,b)\) and \((c,d)\) is determined by Pythagorus: \(\sqrt{(c-a)^2 + (b-d)^2}\text{.}\) This function, with squares and a square root, is not the nicest funtion to work with and differentiate. However, if two points are at an optimized distance (closest or most distance in some situation), the square of the distance will also be smallest or largest. Obviously, the square of the distance is a different number, but it is optimized at the same place that distance is optmized. For this reason, we usually optimize the square of distance: \((c-a)^2 + (b-d)^2\text{.}\) Having removed the square root, this is a much easier function to work with.</p>

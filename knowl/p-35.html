<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The conics are the second important class of loci. Unlike lines, in conics we allow squares of the variables. Conics are a very old topic in mathematics; their names and definitions come from ancient Greece. They are called conics (short for conic sections) since they can be formed by taking slices of a hollow cone at various angles. We will give three equivalent definitions for each conic: one instrinsically geometric definition, one as a the slice of a cone, and one by algebraic equations. For the algebraic equations, we will assume that the conic is centred at the origin. (More general conics can be formed by shifting the conics centered at the origin. <a href="section-shifts.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.5: Shifts">SectionÂ 1.5</a> describes these shifts).</p>

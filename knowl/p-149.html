<p>Our analysis of functions helps us understand models.  We can ask questions about functions inspired by their applied context. We'll start with three important questions.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Do we restrict the domain to make it reasonable?  A mathematical model where the independant variable is human population would reasonably impose restriction that the population must be positive and bounded above by some maximum population.  These restrictions of the model exist in addition to whatever natural mathematical restrictions we already have on domain.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We can ask abour starting values.  If our model depends on time, we can set a starting time (often but not necessarily \(t=0\)) and specify a value for the function at the starting time.  Even though there is a mathematical description of what happens before the starting time, we can ignore it since it doesn't apply to the situation we are modelling.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We can ask about the constants in our model.  Functions often involve constants apart from the variables, such at the coefficients of a polynomial.  In a model, the constants should have reasonable meaning and interpretation.</p></li>
</ul>

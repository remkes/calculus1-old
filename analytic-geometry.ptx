    <title>The Cartesian Plane</title>
    <p>
      Analytic geometry was a huge breakthrough for mathematics.
      Prior to the 17th century, algebra and geometry were haphazardly
      connected branches of mathematics. Various attempts had been
      made to give algebraic descriptions to geometric objects
      (including some primitive versions of cartesian coordinates long
      before Descartes), but none of these ideas and systems had
      managed to give a systematic and thorough connection. In the
      17th century, Descartes proposed the coordinate system which now
      bears his name: the cartesian coordinates. Assigning numerical
      values to points in the plane (2 dimensional) or space (3
      dimensional) allowed geometric problems to be interpreted
      algebraically, and vice-versa. Moreover, this connection was
      complete and systematic: in theory, any geometry in the plane or
      space could be described by Descartes' coordinates. This
      breakthrough was fundamental to the use of mathematics in the
      sciences, starting in the early modern age and continuing into
      the present. Cartesian coordinates must be numbered among a
      very short list of the most important mathematical advances in
      history.

      The basic idea of cartesian coordinates should be familiar to
      you from your previous mathematical experience. In the plane,
      cartesian coordinates are formed by choosing a center point,
      drawing two perpendicular directions called axes (usually, but
      not necessarily, labelled <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>), and describing
      each point in the plane by two real numbers, written
      <m>(a,b)</m>, representing how far along each axis the point
      falls. By convention, moving right and upward are considered
      positive directions on the axes. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For our purposes, the coordinates <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are
      always real numbers. Though we frequently deal with
      integer or rational coordinates, the system allows for any real
      numbers to represent coordinates. Since there are two
      dimensions in the plane, we refer to the plane with cartesian
      coordinates as <m>\RR^2</m>. Similarly, for space with
      cartesian coordinates <m>(a,b,c)</m>, we write <m>\RR^3</m>.
      The axes in <m>\RR^3</m> are typically called <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>
      and <m>z</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though we won't deal with higher dimensions in this course, the
      cartesian coordinate system generalizes easily to any number of
      dimensions. We can no longer visualize or draw the geometry in
      higher dimensions, but we can still work with the algebraic
      representation according to the same principles. For example,
      in <m>\RR^5</m>, there are five axes, all perpendicular to each
      other, and points are represented by five real numbers
      <m>(a,b,c,d,e)</m>, showing the distance along each of the axes.
      We write <m>\RR^n</m> for a cartesian system in general <m>n</m>
      dimensions. This is one of the most powerful aspects of
      cartesian coordinates <mdash /> we can now do geometry in many
      dimensions and transcend the limitations of our
      three-dimensional vision and perception.

      Cartesian coordinate are useful for giving algebraic definitions
      for various geometric shapes and objects. For an equation in
      <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, the coresponding shape consists of all
      points <m>(a,b)</m> in the plane which satisfy the equation when
      <m>x</m> is replaced by <m>a</m> and <m>y</m> is replaced by
      <m>b</m>. Such an collection of points is called <em>locus</em>
      of the equation. The plural of locus is <em>loci</em>. In <xref
      ref="figure-circle-locus" />, the familiar circle of radius
      <m>1</m> is the locus of the equation <m>x^2 + y^2 = 1</m>.

      The first two kinds of loci we will understanrd are line (in
      <xref ref="section-lines" />) and conics (in section <xref
      ref="section-conics" />). Lines are first both because their
      geometry is approachable and because they are loci of the most
      basic kinds of equations. Conics follow as loci of the next more
      approachable kind of equation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lines and conics are just two of many classes and families of
      loci in <m>\RR^2</m>. Here are some others.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            A curve in <m>\RR^2</m>: While curves include lines and
            conics, the term <sq>curve</sq> is a general term for
            curving paths. Many equations give rise to complicated
            curves, which can be very unpredicable. Future calculus
            courses will study the calculus of curves.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Instead of lines, we can restrict to portions of lines.
            For example, the piece of the line <m>y=x</m> that has
            only positive <m>x</m> coordinates is the ray pointing out
            from the origin at an angle of <m>\pi/4</m> radians. By
            taking finite pieces, we get line segments.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            With line segments, we can form straight-edged objects
            such as polygons. They are also loci not defined by one
            particular equation, but by the equations of several lines
            and restriction of those lines.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      These are far from the only examples. Curves and loci can be
      very complicated: they can double back and self intersect, they
      can be jagged and disconnected, and they can even be very
      strange space filling fractals. Several strange situations
      occur; consider the locus
      of the equation <m>x^2 + y^2 =0</m>. Though this is a
      reasonable equation in the coordinate variables <m>x</m> and
      <m>y</m>, this locus only has one point: <m>(0,0)</m>. Since
      <m>x^2</m> and <m>y^2</m> are always positive, no other values
      satisfy. Worse, consider <m>x^2 + y^2 = -1</m>. This locus has
      no points at all, since the left side cannot be negative and the
      right side certainly is.

    <p>
      Graphs of functions are also loci. If <m>f(x)</m> is a
      real-valued function, then the locus <m>y = f(x)</m> is the
      graph of that function. Note that the graph itself is not the
      function, but just a geometric picture or representation of what
      the function does.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since each value <m>x</m> leads to at most one function value
      <m>f(x)</m>, the graph of a function has the important property
      that for any fixed value <m>x</m>, there is only one point of
      the locus with that <m>x</m> coordinate. This is usually
      refered to a a vertical line test <mdash /> a vertical line can
      cross the graph of a function at most once. Many of the loci
      we've seen above do not satisfy this; therefore, they cannot be
      graphs of functions. In addition, graphs never double back and
      never self-intersect.

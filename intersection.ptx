      If two lines in the plane are not parallel, there
      will be exactly one point where they meet. This is called the
      intersection point.  <xref ref="figure-intersection-of-lines"
      /> shows the lines <m>y=x+1</m> and <m>y=3x-x</m> and their
      intersection point at <m>(2,3)</m>. At this intersection
      point, the coordinates <m>(x,y)</m> satisfy both equations.
      Algebraically, we can find this point by solving the system
      composed of both equation. I'll do the calculation. Since the
      <m>y</m> must be the same in both equations to find the
      interesction, I can make both of the <m>x</m> expressions equal
      as well. Then I can solve for the <m>x</m> coordinates. Finally,
      I can use that <m>x</m> coordinate to solve for the <m>y</m>
      coordinate using either line equation.

      This example show the general idea. A point is on the
      intersection of two loci if its coordinates satisfy both
      equations. Algebraically, I find this point by solving the
      system of equations using the equations for both loci. There are
      many techniques for solving systems: isolating one variable and
      replacing it, adding equations together, solving for one
      variable in both equations, etc. Feel free to rely on whatever
      techniques you may have learned for solving systems in your
      previous mathematical experience.

    <title>Intersection of Lines and Conics</title>
    <p>
      With any two loci, there is the possibility of intersection; I
      would simply have to find some point <m>(x,y)</m> that satisfied
      both equations. The algebraic approach to finding intersection
      is also the same as above for line. Finding an intersection
      point is accomplished by solving the system of equations.
      However, once the equations are no longer linear, solving that
      system can get much more difficult and complication. There many
      be no solutions or many solutions. It may be impossible to find
      the solution by exact value, meaning that approximation is the
      only technique. I'm not going to go do deeply into the theory of
      intersections in this course, but I'll I do want to cover
      intersection involving both lines and conics. I'll do this by
      example.

        In <xref ref="figure-intersection-line-ellipse" />, the ellipse
        <m>\frac{x^2}{4} + \frac{y^2}{1} = 1</m> and the line
        <m>y=-x</m> have two intersection points. I can solve for those
        point by using the equation of the line to replace a variable.
        If I replace <m>y</m> with <m>-x</m> in the equation of the
        ellipse, that equation simplifies as follows.
        <me>
          \frac{5x^2}{4} = 1 \implies x = \pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} 
        </me>
        Now I know the <m>x</m> values of the intersection point. The
        line equation <m>y = -x</m> reminds me that the <m>y</m> values
        are just the negative of the <m>x</m> values. With that
        reminder, I can write down the coordinates of the two
        intersection points: <m>p_1 =
        (\frac{-2}{\sqrt{5}},\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}})</m> and <m>p_2 =
        (\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}},\frac{-2}{\sqrt{5}})</m>.

      You will also be expected to find the intersections of lines.
      In <xref ref="intersection-of-lines">Figure</xref>, we have the
      lines <m>y=x+1</m> and <m>y=3-3x</m>. Finding the intersetion
      point is equivalent to finding two coordinates <m>x</m> and
      <m>y</m> which satisfy both equations. Algebraically, that is
      solving the system composed of both equation.

      Intersection is a key idea in analytic geometry. Given two loci
      in <m>\RR^n</m>, we often want to know if they intersect. In
      <xref ref="figure-intersection">diagram</xref>, the ellipse
      <m>\frac{x^2}{4} + \frac{y^2}{1} = 1</m> and the line
      <m>y=-x</m> have two intersection points: <m>p_1 =
      (\frac{-2}{\sqrt{5}},\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}})</m> and <m>p_2 =
      (\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}},\frac{-2}{\sqrt{5}})</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with intersection of lines, finding the intersection of loci
      is the same as asking for common solutions of the equations.
      Solving systems of equations is one of the most basic tasks in
      mathematics. and intersection is the geometric interpretation.

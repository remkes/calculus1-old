      If two lines in the plane are not parallel or identitcal, there
      will be exactly one point where they meet. This is called the
      intersection point.  In <xref ref="figure-intersection-of-lines"
      />, we have the lines <m>y=x+1</m> and <m>y=3-3x</m> and their
      intersection point at <m>(2,3)</m>. This is the intersection
      point because it is the only point where the coordinates satisfy
      both equations. Algebraically, we can find this point by solving
      the system composed of both equation.

      This examples show the general theory. A point is on the
      intersection of two loci if its coordinates satisfy both
      equations. Algebraically, we find this point by solving the
      system of equations using the equations for both loci. There are
      many techniques for solving systems: isolating one variable and
      replacing it, adding equations together, solving for one
      variable in both equations, etc. Feel free to rely on whatever
      techniques you may have learned for solving systems in your
      previous mathematical experience.

      In <xref ref="figure-intersection-line-ellipse" />, the ellipse
      <m>\frac{x^2}{4} + \frac{y^2}{1} = 1</m> and the line
      <m>y=-x</m> have two intersection points. We can solve for those
      point by using the equation of the line to replace a variable.
      If we replace <m>y</m> with <m>-x</m> in the equation of the
      ellipse, that equation simplifies to 
      <me>
        \frac{5x^2}{4} = 1 \implies x = \pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} 
      </me>.
      Now I know the <m>x</m> values of the intersection point. The
      line equation <m>y = -x</m> reminds me that the <m>y</m> values
      are just the negative of the <m>x</m> values. With that
      reminder, I can write down the coordinates of the two
      intersection points: <m>p_1 =
      (\frac{-2}{\sqrt{5}},\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}})</m> and <m>p_2 =
      (\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}},\frac{-2}{\sqrt{5}})</m>.

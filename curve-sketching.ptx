  <title>Curve Sketching</title>
  <p>
    In the last two lectures of the course, we want to pull together
    all of the techniques we have learned in order to develop a
    holistic way of describing functions. The first holistic problem
    is drawing graphs of function. Curve sketching is attempting to
    draw functions (without computer assistance) based on the
    properties we can derive using algebra and calculus.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before we get to the general process of curve sketching, we need
    to talk about interpretation of derivatives. We have seen in the
    previous lectures that the first derivative gives us information
    about increase and decrease. If <m>f^\prime(x)</m> is positive,
    the function is increasing, and if <m>f^\prime(x)</m> is negative,
    the function is decreasing. If <m>f^\prime(x) = 0</m>, then we
    may have a maximum or minimum.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have a similar interpretation for the second derivative. The
    first derivative is slope, so the second derivative is the rate of
    change of slope. That measures the concavity of the graph:
    whether it is curving upwards or downwards. These shapes are
    called concave up and concave down, respectively. If <m>f^{\prime
    \prime}(x)</m> is positive, then the function is concave up
    (curving updwards) and if <m>f^{\prime \prime}(x)</m> is negative,
    the function is concave down (curving downards). Where
    <m>f^{\prime \prime}(x) = 0</m> we might have a change in
    concavity; we call these points inflection points.
  </p>
  <p>
    When we sketch a curve, we will consider all of the following.
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Domain. We determine domain by looking for domain
          restrctions such as division by zero.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Range. Range is still difficult, even with calculus,
          However, once we know minima, maxima, increase and decrease,
          we can often figure out the range.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Continuity. For standard functions, we get continuity for
          free on the domain. For piecewise functions, we have to do
          some work to investigate continuity at the cross-over
          points.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Intercepts. We evaluate <m>f(0)</m> for the
          <m>y</m>-intercept, provided that <m>x=0</m> is in the
          domain. For the <m>x</m>-intercepts, we try to solve
          <m>f(x) = 0</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Symmetry. We look for odd (<m>f(-x) = -f(x)</m>) or even
          (<m>f(-x) = f(x)</m>) symmetry, as well as periodicity
          (<m>f(x+p) = f(x)</m>).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Limits and Asymptotes. We look at limits near undefined
          points. If these limits are infinite, we get vertical
          asymptotes. We also look at limits at <m>\pm \infty</m>.
          If these limits are finite, we get a horizontal asymptotes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          First Derivative. We calculate the first derivative and
          solve <m>f^\prime(x) =0</m> to find the critical points. We
          classify these points to find the minima or maxima. We also
          get the intervals of increase or decrease (which often let
          us determine the range, as mentioned before).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Second Derivative. We calculate the second derivative and
          solve <m>f^{\prime \prime}(x) = 0</m> to find the inflection
          points. We also get the intervals of concavity from the
          sign of the second derivative.

        Consider this function: <m>f(x) = x \ln x</m>.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The domain is <m>x > 0</m>.

          <li>
            <p>
              The range is unclear from first impressions.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The function is continuous.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              There is no symmetry.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              There is no <m>y</m> intercept. The <m>x</m> intercept
              is <m>(1,0)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The only boundary point of the domain is <m>x=0</m>.
              The limit as <m>x=0</m> is
              <me>
                \lim_{x \rightarrow 0^+} x \ln x = \lim_{x \rightarrow
                0_+} \frac{\ln x}{\frac{1}{x}} = \lim_{x \rightarrow
                0^+} \frac{\frac{1}{x}}{\frac{-1}{x^2}} = \lim_{x
                \rightarrow 0^+} -x = 0
              </me>
              Therefore, there are no vertical asymptotes. The limit
              as <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m> is <m>\infty</m>, so
              there are no horizontal asymptotes.

              We look at the first derivative: <m>f^\prime(x) = \ln x
              + 1</m>, so <m>f^\prime(x) = 0</m> implies <m>x =
              \frac{1}{e}</m>. The point <m>\left( \frac{1}{e},
              \frac{-1}{e} \right)</m> is a potential extrema.

    <title>The Idea of Curve Sketching</title>
    <p>
      In the last section of the course, I want to pull together
      all of the techniques I have shown in order to develop a
      holistic way of describing functions. The first holistic problem
      is drawing graphs of function. Curve sketching is attempting to
      draw functions (without computer assistance) based on the
      properties derived using algebra and calculus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I get to the general process of curve sketching, I need
      to talk about interpretation of derivatives. I have shown in the
      previous lectures that the first derivative gives information
      about increase and decrease. If <m>f^\prime(x)</m> is positive,
      the function is increasing, and if <m>f^\prime(x)</m> is negative,
      the function is decreasing. If <m>f^\prime(x) = 0</m>, then
      there may be a maximum or minimum.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a similar interpretation for the second derivative. The
      first derivative is slope, so the second derivative is the rate of
      change of slope. That measures the concavity of the graph:
      whether it is curving upwards or downwards. These shapes are
      called concave up and concave down, respectively. If <m>f^{\prime
      \prime}(x)</m> is positive, then the function is concave up
      (curving updwards) and if <m>f^{\prime \prime}(x)</m> is negative,
      the function is concave down (curving downards). Where
      <m>f^{\prime \prime}(x) = 0</m> there might be a change in
      concavity; these points are called inflection points.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I sketch a graph, I will consider all of the following
      eight attributes of the graph.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Domain. I determine domain by looking for domain
            restrctions such as division by zero.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Range. Range is still difficult, even with calculus,
            However, once I know minima, maxima, increase and decrease,
            I can often figure out the range. Therefore, even though
            I've listed it here, range is often the very last step.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Continuity. For standard functions, I get continuity for
            free on the domain. For piecewise functions, I have to do
            some work to investigate continuity at the cross-over
            points.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Intercepts. I evaluate <m>f(0)</m> to calculate the
            <m>y</m>-intercept, provided that <m>x=0</m> is in the
            domain. For the <m>x</m>-intercepts, I try to solve
            <m>f(x) = 0</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Symmetry. I look for odd (<m>f(-x) = -f(x)</m>) or even
            (<m>f(-x) = f(x)</m>) symmetry, as well as periodicity
            (<m>f(x+p) = f(x)</m>).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Limits and Asymptotes. I look at limits near undefined
            points. If these limits are infinite, there are vertical
            asymptotes. I also look at limits at <m>\pm \infty</m>.
            If these limits are finite, there are horizontal asymptotes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            First Derivative. I calculate the first derivative and
            solve <m>f^\prime(x) =0</m> to find the critical points. I
            classify these points to find the minima or maxima. I also
            get the intervals of increase or decrease (which often let
            me determine the range, as mentioned before).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Second Derivative. I calculate the second derivative and
            solve <m>f^{\prime \prime}(x) = 0</m> to find the inflection
            points. I also get the intervals of concavity from the
            sign of the second derivative.
          </p>
        </li>

          Consider this function: <m>f(x) = x \ln x</m>. I'll go
          through the eight properties for sketching the graph of the
          function.
        </p>
        <p><ol>
          <li>
            The domain is <m>x > 0</m>, due to the logarithm. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The range is unclear from first impressions.
          </li>
          <li>
            The function is continuous on its domain.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is no symmetry.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is no <m>y</m> intercept. The <m>x</m> intercept
            is <m>(1,0)</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The only boundary point of the domain is <m>x=0</m>.
            The limit as <m>x=0</m> is calcluate by the limit
            approacing the undefined point (on the positive side
            only). 
            <me>
              \lim_{x \rightarrow 0^+} x \ln x = \lim_{x \rightarrow
              0^+} \frac{\ln x}{\frac{1}{x}} = \lim_{x \rightarrow
              0^+} \frac{\frac{1}{x}}{\frac{-1}{x^2}} = \lim_{x
              \rightarrow 0^+} -x = 0
            </me>
            Since this limit is no infinite, there are no vertical
            asymptotes. The limit as <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m> is
            <m>\infty</m>, so there are no horizontal asymptotes
            either.
          </li>
          <li>
            I look at the first derivative: <m>f^\prime(x) = \ln x +
            1</m>, so <m>f^\prime(x) = 0</m> implies <m>x =
            \frac{1}{e}</m>. The point <m>\left( \frac{1}{e},
            \frac{-1}{e} \right)</m> is a potential extrema. I'll go
            throught the process of looking at the intervals.

            The point <m>\left( \frac{1}{e}, \frac{-1}{e}
            \right)</m> is a local minimum.
          </li>
          <li>
            I look at the second derivative: <m>f^{\prime
            \prime}(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m>. The second derivative is
            always positive, so the function is concave up on <m>(0,
            \infty)</m>, which is the entire domain.
          </li>
        </ol></p>
        <p>
          At the end of the process, I can return to the question of
          range. There is a minimum at <m>x = \frac{1}{3}</m>, with
          <m>y</m> value <m>\frac{-1}{e}</m>. Since this is a minimum
          and the fucntion grows to infinity, the range must be
          <m>\left[ \frac{-1}{e}, \infty \right)</m>.  <xref

          At the end of the process, we can reconsider range. There is
          a maximum at <m>x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}</m>, with <m>y</m>
          value <m>\frac{e^{-\frac{1}{2}}}{\sqrt{2}}</m>. The function
          grows to this value and then decays to zero. The behaviour
          for the minimum is the same below the axis, due to the odd
          symmetry.  Therefore, the range must be <m>\left(

            The first derivative is <m>f^\prime (x) = 4x^3 + 24x^2 -
            540x</m>, which has roots of <m>0</m>, <m>9</m> and
            <m>-15</m>. The critical points are <m>(0, 1)</m>,
            <m>(9, -9476)</m> and <m>(-15, -37124)</m>. I'll look at
            the intervals to classify the critical points.

          I said the range was boudned below. Now that I know the
          <m>x</m> coordinates of the two minima, I just need to
          which one has the least value. I asked a computer for
          these calculations. When <m>x = -15</m>, the function
          value is <m>-37115</m>. When <m>x = 9</m>, the function
          value is <m>-9467</m>. The first minimum is lower, so the
          range is <m>(-37114, \infty)</m>.  <xref
          ref="figure-curve-sketching3" /> shows the resulting
          graph.

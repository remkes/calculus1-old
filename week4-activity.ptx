          I cannot directly evaluate, since that would lead to
          division by zero. However, I can logically analyze this
          limit. The numerator is fixed and the denominator is getting
          very small. Division by smaller and smaller numbers leads to
          larger and larger numbers. I conclude the limit must be
          infinite.The denominator can be negative or positive, so we
          write 
         <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 3} \frac{1}{x-3} = \pm \infty

          The numerator and denominator both approach zero. This is an
          indeterminate form of type <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>. I need to do
          some manipulations to deal with it. Both terms are
          quadratic, so I will try to factor them to simplify the
          limit.

          Both the numerator and denominator approach zero, so this is

          do anything to the numerator, but I can factor the

          factors using the special pattern for sums of cubes.

      <solution>
        <p>
          This limit includes <m>x</m> and <m>\sin x</m>. I will 
          use the known limit for the ratio of these two
          functions. I need to manipulate this limit to isolate the known
          limit, using the rules for limits and multiplication.

            \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin^2 x}{x} = \lim_{x

            \sin x
          </me>
          Then the first part of this is the known limit, which
          evaluates to 1. The second part can be directly evaluated to
          0. The product of 1 and 0 is 0, so the limit is 0.

        <p>
          This involves trigonometry and <m>x</m>, so I will try to
          isolate the ration of <m>x</m> and <m>\sin x</m>. To do that
          I have to write cotagents in terms of sine and cosine. 
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} x \cot x = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} x
            \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
          </me>
          Then I manipulate the limit to isolate the known ratio of
          <m>x</m> amd <m>sin x</m>.
          <me>
            = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{x}{\sin x} \cos x = \lim_{x
            \rightarrow 0} \frac{x}{\sin x} \lim_{x \rightarrow 0}
            \cos x
          </me>
          Now there are two limits, each of which evaluate to 1, so
          the original limit is also 1.

    <title>Vertical Asymptotes</title>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the vertical asymptotes of the the function
          <me>
            f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2-4x+3}

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          To find vertical asymptotes of a rational function, I look
          for the points on the edge of the domain and take the limits
          approaching those points. Here, domain is all real number
          except <m>x=3</m> and <m>x=1</m>. Those two numbers are the
          roots of the denominator. To determine whether there are
          vertical asymptotes at the undefined points, I need to
          take the limits approaching them. I have two limits to
          consider.
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 1} \frac{1}{x^2-4x+3} \text{ and }
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 3} \frac{1}{x^2-4x+3} 
          </me>
          Both of these limits are limits where the numerator is fixed
          and the denominator approaches 0. In these cases, dividing by
          very small numbers produced very large numbers, so the
          limits are both <m>\pm \infty</m>. Since the limits are
          infinite, I conclucde that the lines <m>x=1</m> and
          <m>x=3</m> are both vertical asymptotes.

          To find vertical asymptotes of a rational function, I look

          approaching those points. Here, domain is all real number
          except <m>x=3</m> and <m>x=-4</m>. Those two numbers are the

          </me>
          In the first limit, the <m>(x-3)</m> terms cancel out and
          the limit can be directly evaluted to <m>\frac{1}{7}</m>.
          Since this limit if not infinite, this is not a vertical
          asymptote.  In the second limit, the numerator is fixed
          and the denominator approaches 0. In this case, dividing by
          very small numbers produced very large numbers, so the
          limit is <m>\pm \infty</m>. Since the limit is 
          infinite, I conclucde that the line <m>x=-4</m> is
          is a vertical asymptote.

          Unlike the previous questions, this is more about
          familiarity with common functions and shifts in the plane.
          I know that the logarithm has an asymptote at <m>x=0</m>.
          Replacing <m>x</m> by <m>(x-4)</m> is a shift of 4 units in
          the positive direction, so this function has a vertical
          asymptote at <m>x=4</m>.

          This is also about familiarity with known functions. I
          know the tangent function has asymptotes at every odd
          multiple of <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m>. In this function, I
          multiply by 3 inside the tangent function. This
          multiplication moves the asymptotes closer together. There
          are now asymptotes at every odd multiple of <m>
          \frac{\pi}{6}</m>.

      <solution>
        <p>
          I take the limits from the left and from the right to
          determine continuity. Both limits can be evaluated directly:
          the limit from the left is <m>\frac{e}{16}</m> from the
          right is <m>\frac{39}{12}e^{\frac{10}{7}}</m>. The
          approximate values of these numbers is, respectively,
          <m>0.1699</m> and <m>13.5614</m>. These are not the same, so
          the function is not continuous. At <m>t=10</m> the population
          has a sudden and significant jump; through some process, a
          large population has suddenly been added to the existing
          population.

            T(t) = 24 + \frac{\sqrt{(t-5)^3}}{t-5}
          </me>
          The point <m>t=5</m> is the edge of the domain of this

          I take the limit. 
          <me>
            \lim_{t \rightarrow 5} 24 +
            \frac{\sqrt{(t-5)^3}}{t-5} = 24 + \lim_{t \rightarrow 5}
            \frac{(t-5)}{(t-5)} \sqrt{t-5} = 24 + 0 = 24 
          </me>
          Even though the function is undefined, the limit is
          reasonable and the temperature simply approaches 24. This
          tells me that even though the domain is undefined past this
          point, the model has reasonable and predicatable behaviour.

          The numerator is fixed and the denominator approaches zero.
          A fixed number divided by a smaller and smaller number
          produces a larger and larger number, so this limit diverges
          to infinity. The denominator factors as <m>(x-4)^2</m>; it
          is a square, so it is always positive. Therefore, the limit
          diverges specifically to positive infinity.

          First, I can take the limit inside the square root. (This is
          an application of the limit laws with exponents, since the
          square root is the same as the exponent <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>.)

          Both numerator and denominator approach zero, so this is an
          indeterminate form of type <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>. I can factor
          the denominator and cancel off a term to simplify. Then I
          can directly evaluate.

          I can't even evaluate the pieces here, since there is
          division by zero in both of the fractions in the numerator.
          However, I can try to use common denominator and
          simplification of the nested fraction to put this is a more
          reasonable form. 
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\frac{1}{x} -
            \frac{1}{x^2}}{x} = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0}
            \frac{\frac{x-1}{x^2}}{x} = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0}
            \frac{x-1}{x^3} 
          </me>
          Then I can analyze the pieces. The numerator approaches
          <m>-1</m>. The denominator approach <m>0</m>. Something
          close to <m>-1</m> divided by smaller and smaller numbers
          produces larger and larger numbers. Therefore, I conclude
          that the limit diverges to infintiy. It could be positive or
          negative, since the denominator involves both very small
          positive and negative values approaching zero.

          The numerator approaches <m>1</m> and the denominator
          approach <m>0</m>. Dividing by smaller and smaller numbers
          produces larger and larger numbers, so this limit must
          diverge to inifnity. The numerator is postiive and the
          denominator, since it is a square, is also positive, so I
          know, specifically, that this diverges to positive infinity.

          This involves trigonometry and <m>x</m>, so I will try to
          use the know limit that relates <m>x</m> and <m>\sin x</m>.
          To do that, I'll write tangents as the ration of sine over
          cosine. 
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\tan^2 x}{x^2} = 
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin^2 x}{(\cos^2 x) x^2} = 
          </me>
          Now I can use the limit laws to break this up into pieces,
          to try to isolate the known limit. 
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin^2 x}{(\cos^2 x) x^2} = 
            \left( \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{\cos^2 x} \right) 
            \left( \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} \right) 
            \left( \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} \right) 
          </me>
          Now I have isolated three limits that I know how to
          calculate. The limit with the cosine can be directly
          evaluated. The other two are both the known limit that
          evalutes to <m>1</m>.
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin^2 x}{(\cos^2 x) x^2} = 
            \left( \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{\cos^2 x} \right) 
            \left( \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} \right) 
            \left( \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} \right) = 1
            \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 1

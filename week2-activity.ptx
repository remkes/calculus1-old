    <title>Composing Functions</title>
    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Compose the functions <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x+4}</m> and <m>g(x)
          = x^2 - 4</m> in both orders. Determine the domain of both
          compositions. 
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          For the composition <m>f \circ g</m>, <m>f</m> is the
          outside function and <m>g</m> is the inside function. We use
          the function <m>g</m> to replace the variable in the
          function <m>f</m>.
          <me>
            f \circ g(x) = \frac{1}{(x^2-4) + 4} = \frac{1}{x^2} 
          </me>
          In the resulting function, we need to exclude <m>x = 0</m>
          to avoid division by zero. The inside function <m>g</m> has
          no restriction, so there are no other domain concerns and
          the domain is all real numbers except 0.

          For the composition <m>g \circ f</m>, <m>g</m> is the
          outside function and <m>f</m> is the inside function. We use

          <me>
            g \circ f(x) = \left( \frac{1}{x+4} \right)^2 - 4 =
            \frac{1}{(x+4)^2} - 4 
          </me>
          In the resulting function, we need to exclude <m>x = -4</m>
          to avoid division by zero. The inside function <m>f</m> has
          the same restriction, <m>x \neq -4</m>, so there are no
          other domain concerns and the domain is all real numbers
          except <m>-4</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Compose the functions <m>f(x) = e^{x^2-1}</m> and <m>g(x)
          = \sqrt{x^3-5}</m> in both orders. Determine the domain of both
          compositions. 
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          For the composition <m>f \circ g</m>, <m>f</m> is the
          outside function and <m>g</m> is the inside function. We use
          the function <m>g</m> to replace the variable in the
          function <m>f</m>.
          <me>
            f \circ g(x) = e^{(\sqrt{x^3-5})^2-1} = e^{x^3-5-1} =
            e^{x^3-6}
          </me>
          The resulting function have no obvious domain restrictons.
          However, since we have to do the inside function <m>g</m>
          first, we need to respect the domain restrictions of
          <m>g</m>. The argument in the square root needs to be
          positive, we we need <m>x^3-5 \geq 0</m>. This inequality
          simplifies into <m>x^3 \geq 5</m> and further to <m> x \geq
          \sqrt[3]{5}</m>. Therefore, the domain of the composition is
          all real number <m>x \geq \sqrt[3]{5}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the composition <m>g \circ f</m>, <m>g</m> is the
          outside function and <m>f</m> is the inside function. We use
          the function <m>f</m> to replace the variable in the
          function <m>g</m>.
          <me>
            g \circ f(x) = \sqrt{(e^{x^2-1})^3 - 5} =
            \sqrt{e^{3(x^2-1)} - 5}
          </me>
          We've simplified this one step using the laws of exponents.
          Even though this is still a complicated expression, there
          aren't any more reasonable simplification. The domain
          restrictions are also complicated here. The inside function
          <m>f</m> has no restrictions, so we only have to worry about
          the final form; unfortunately, that final form isn't easy to
          pull apart. The square root is the only restrict, so the
          term inside the square root must be non-negative. Let's work
          with that inequality a bit. (We're going to apply a
          logarithm to get ride of the exponential; this respect the
          inequality, since the logarithm is an increasing function.
          Any increasing function preserves inequalities and an
          decreasing function reverses them.)

          After the manipulation of this inequality, we do get an
          understandable domain restriction. This composition is
          define for all real numbers <m>x \geq \sqrt{\frac{1}{3} \ln
          5 + 1}</m>.

    <title>Composing Functions</title>
    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Compose the functions <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x+4}</m> and
          <m>g(x) = x^2 - 4</m> in both orders. Determine the domain
          of both compositions.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          For the composition <m>f \circ g</m>, <m>f</m> is the
          outside function and <m>g</m> is the inside function. I use
          the function <m>g</m> to replace the variable in the
          function <m>f</m>.
          <me>
            f \circ g(x) = \frac{1}{(x^2-4) + 4} = \frac{1}{x^2} 
          </me>
          In the resulting function, I need to exclude <m>x = 0</m>
          to avoid division by zero. The inside function <m>g</m> has
          no restrictions, so there are no other domain concerns and
          the domain is all real numbers except 0.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the composition <m>g \circ f</m>, <m>g</m> is the
          outside function and <m>f</m> is the inside function. I use
          the function <m>f</m> to replace the variable in the

          <me>
            g \circ f(x) = \left( \frac{1}{x+4} \right)^2 - 4 =
            \frac{1}{(x+4)^2} - 4 
          </me>
          In the resulting function, I need to exclude <m>x = -4</m>
          to avoid division by zero. The inside function <m>f</m> has
          the same restriction, <m>x \neq -4</m>, so there are no
          other domain concerns and the domain is all real numbers
          except <m>-4</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>

    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Compose the functions <m>f(x) = e^{x^2-1}</m> and <m>g(x) =
          \sqrt{x^3-5}</m> in both orders. Determine the domain of
          both compositions.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          For the composition <m>f \circ g</m>, <m>f</m> is the
          outside function and <m>g</m> is the inside function. I use
          the function <m>g</m> to replace the variable in the
          function <m>f</m>.
          <me>
            f \circ g(x) = e^{(\sqrt{x^3-5})^2-1} = e^{x^3-5-1} =
            e^{x^3-6}
          </me>
          The resulting function has no obvious domain restrictons.
          However, since I have to do the inside function <m>g</m>
          first, I need to respect the domain restrictions of
          <m>g</m>. The argument in the square root needs to be
          positive, I need <m>x^3-5 \geq 0</m>. This inequality
          simplifies into <m>x^3 \geq 5</m> and further to <m> x \geq
          \sqrt[3]{5}</m>. Therefore, the domain of the composition is
          all real numbers <m>x \geq \sqrt[3]{5}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the composition <m>g \circ f</m>, <m>g</m> is the
          outside function and <m>f</m> is the inside function. I use
          the function <m>f</m> to replace the variable in the
          function <m>g</m>.
          <me>
            g \circ f(x) = \sqrt{(e^{x^2-1})^3 - 5} =
            \sqrt{e^{3(x^2-1)} - 5}
          </me>
          I've simplified this one step using the laws of exponents.
          Even though this is still a complicated expression, there
          aren't any more reasonable simplifications. The domain
          restrictions are also complicated here. The inside function
          <m>f</m> has no restrictions, so I only have to worry about
          the final form; unfortunately, that final form isn't easy to
          pull apart. The square root is the only restriction, so the
          term inside the square root must be non-negative. I will
          work with that inequality a bit. (I'm going to apply a
          logarithm to get ride of the exponential; this respects the
          inequality, since the logarithm is an increasing function.
          Any increasing function preserves inequalities and an
          decreasing function reverses them.)

          After the manipulation of this inequality, I get an
          understandable domain restriction. This composition is
          defined for all real numbers <m>x \geq \sqrt{\frac{1}{3} \ln
          5 + 1}</m>.

        <p>
          Express the function <m>f(x) = \sqrt[4]{x^2-4}</m> as a
          composition of two functions.

        <p>
          I want to write <m>f = g \circ h</m> for some functions
          <m>g</m> and <m>h</m>. I need to break this into successive
          processes. The first observation is that the fourth root
          is the last operations of the function: first I square the
          variable, then subtract 4, then apply the fourth root.
          Therefore, the fourth root is a reasonable choice of the
          outside function, with everything inside the root as the
          inside function. That gives a decomposition.
          <me>
            f = g \circ h \text{ where } g(x) = \sqrt[4]{x} \text{ and
            } h(x) = x^2-4
          </me>
          Note that this isn't the only possible answer. Often there
          are many ways to break apart a function as the composition
          of two (or more) pieces. Here is another possibility.
          <me>
            f = g \circ h \text{ where } g(x) = \sqrt[4]{x-4} \text{
            and } h(x) = x^2

          processes. If I want the simplest outside function, I can
          observe that the sine function is the last step, applied to
          everything else in the function. I could choose the sine
          function as the outside function, leaving everything else as
          the inside.

            f = g \circ h \text{ where } g(x) = \sin (x) \text{ and

          </me>
          There are other possible solutions. Here is one where I
          would like the inside function to be slightly simpler.
          <me>
            f = g \circ h \text{ where } g(x) = \sin (e^x) \text{ and

        <p>
          The function is increasing on this domain (since it is the
          composition of two increasing functions), so it is
          invertible. I follow the steps of the process: set <m>y =
          f(x)</m>, solve for <m>y</m>, then switch variables to write
          the inverse as a function of the conventional independent

          Note that I use the exponential to remove the logarithm:
          these are inverse operations, so one removes the other.

      <solution>
        <p>
          When <m>x > 2 </m>, the logarithm <m>\ln (x-1)</m> is
          positive and growing, so its reciprocal is positive and
          decreasing.  The function is invertible on this domain. I

          for <m>y</m>, then switch variables to write the inverse as
          a function of the conventional independent variables
          <m>x</m>. (In the step from the first to the second line, we
          simply take the reciprocal of each side of the equation;
          when the numerators are not zero, this is a valid
          operation).

          I plot the points of the data set in the cartesian plane.
          The data here points to a increasing function and looks
          mostly linear. I could simply guess a linear function.
          However, there seems to be a jump between 6 and 7, which
          makes a single line a bit problematic. It could be a more
          complicated kind of function which connects the two pieces.
          It would also be a discontinuous piecewise function:
          sometimes functions make sudden jumps. I've chosen this last
          option, and show two different lines for the two pieces of
          the data set.

        <p>
        This is the same form as the exponential form for population
        growth, but with a negative exponent. I can use our
        undersatnding of the parameters in population growth to
        interpret these parameters. When <m>t=0</m>, I have <m>C(0) =
        a</m>, so <m>a</m> the starting value. The coefficient in the
        exponential was the rate of exponential growth for population.
        I can likewise conclude that <m>b</m> is control the rate of
        decay of concentration here. This is decay because there is a 
        negative exponential.

        that the parameters are positive.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
        When the depth is zero, I have <m>p(0) = a</m>. I can
        conclude that <m>a</m> is the pressure at the surface of the
        body of water. Since the parameters are positive, this
        pressure increases linearly as the depth increases. The
        parameter <m>b</m> is the slope of this increas, so it measure
        that rate of which the water gains pressure as depth
        increases.

        Consider <m>h(t) = a + b\sin(\pi t) - ct</m>, a model of

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
        When the time is 0, I have <m>p(0) = a</m>. Therefore, I can
        call <m>a</m> the starting height. The other pieces of the
        function are sinusoidal oscillation linear decline. The
        parameter <m>b</m> is the amplitude of the sinusoidal piece
        and the parameter <m>c</m> is the negative slope of the linear
        decline. The behaviour of the model comes from adding these
        two behaviours together: so I get some oscillations while
        generally having a linear decline.

        function of time. Give an interpretation for the parameters
        <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> in this model. Assume that the
        parameters are positive.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
        When time is 0, I have <m>p(0) = c</m>, so <m>c</m> is the
        starting value of the population. The population is linear,
        with slope <m>a-b</m>. This will be positive or negative
        depending on which parameter is larger. Since the parater
        <m>a</m> is positive but I subtract the parameter <m>b</m>,
        <m>a</m> must have a positive effect on the population and
        <m>b</m> must have a negative effect. The simpliest way to
        interpret this is to assume that <m>a</m> is a birth rate and
        <m>b</m> is a death rate. The population will only grow if the
        rate of briths exceeds the rate of deaths.

    <title>Derivatives of Compositions</title>
    <p>
      The rules so far give the tools to calculate many derivatives.
      However, they don't address composition. How do I differentiate
      <m>\sin x^2</m>?  The rule that addresses derivatives of
      composed functions is called the chain rule. The chain rule has
      two notations, which I'll present in a proposition.
    </p> 
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> be differentiable functions and
          consider the composition <m>f(g(x))</m>. It is often useful
          to label <m>g(x)</m> by a new, temporary variable <m>u =
          g(x)</m>. In the following notation, the vertical line means
          replace <m>u</m> with <m>g(x)</m> after any other
          calculations are finished.
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} f(g(x)) = f^\prime(g(x)) g^\prime(x) = \left.
            \frac{df(u)}{du} \right|_{u=g(x)} \frac{dg}{dx} 
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The proof of the chain rule is tricky, but the following
          steps give the idea. The argument is a little imprecise in
          the fourth step, where I replace <m>g(x)</m> with the
          temporary variable <m>u</m>, since I haven't established
          that such an operation is valid. In the proof, let <m>F = f
          \circ g</m>.

      The variety of notations is somewhat a result of the difficult
      nature of the rule<mdash />it's hard to clearly describe. The
      key idea is to think of composition in terms of inside and
      outside functions. The derivative of the composition is the
      derivative of the outside (<m>f^\prime</m>) evaluted at the
      inside (<m>f^\prime(g(x))</m>), then multiplied by the
      derivative of the inside (<m>g^\prime</m>). There is one other
      way of expressing the chain rule, which looks the most elegant. 
      <me>
        \frac{df}{dx} = \frac{df}{dg} \frac{dg}{dx}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this last version of the chain rule, I treat <m>df</m>,
      <m>dg</m> and <m>dx</m> as something like pieces of fractions in
      Leibniz notation (<m>\frac{df}{dx}</m>).  These terms are not
      fractions, but they act a bit like fractions. (These
      notations come from a different historical treatment of
      calculus, where the rules were constructed with an arithmetic of
      <sq>infinitesimals</sq> <mdash /> infinitely small but non-zero
      numbers.  <m>df</m>, <m>dg</m> and <m>dx</m> were all
      infinitesimals in that alternative construction. This way of
      studying calculus fell out of favour in the 20th century, but
      some of the notation lingers.)
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Here are some chain rule examples. In these examples, I'll
          already use the rule <m> \frac{d}{dx} \ln x =
          \frac{1}{x}</m>, even though the rule will be proved later
          in this section. In the first example, the outside function
          is <m>e^u</m> and the inside function is <m>ax</m>. 
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} e^{ax} = \frac{d}{du} e^u \Bigg|_{u = ax}
            \frac{d}{dx} (ax) =  ae^{ax}
          </me>
          In the next, the outside function is <m>\sin u</m> and the
          inside functon is <m>3x</m>. After the derivatives, I'll
          move the constant to the front of the function. This isn't
          necessary, but fits the general conventions of writing
          constants and polynomials to the left of trigonometric or
          exponential functions. 
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} \sin 3x = \frac{d}{du} \sin u \Bigg|_{u =
            3x} \frac{d}{dx} (3x) = 3 \cos 3x
          </me>
          In the next, the outside function is <m>e^u</m> and the
          inside function is <m>x^2 + 2</m>. 
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} e^{x^2+2} = \frac{d}{du} e^u \Bigg|_{u =
            x^2 + 2} \frac{d}{dx} (x^2 + 2) = (2x) e^{x^2+2}
          </me>
          In the next, the outside function is <m>\ln u</m> and the
          inside function is <m>5x^3 + 7x + 1</m>. 
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} \ln (5x^3 + 7x + 1) = \frac{d}{du} \ln u
            \Bigg|_{u = 5x^3 + 7x + 1} \frac{d}{dx} (5x^3 + 7x + 1) =
            \frac{15x^2 + 7}{5x^3 + 7x + 1}
          </me>
          In the last example, this is a triple compsition. I use the
          chain rule twice, making the outside function as easy as
          possible in each step. The first outside function is <m>\cos
          u</m> and the second outside function is <m>e^v</m>.

          I can use the chain rule to differentiate arbitrary
          exponential functions. I gave an argument for this rule 
          in <xref ref="section-derivative-rules" /> using the limit
          definition, but the argument using the chain rule is more
          direct (one the derivative of <m>e^x</m> is known, at
          least). This derivative uses a common exponential trick,
          where I write <m>a^x</m> as <m>e^{\ln a^x} = e^{a \ln x}</m>.
          Since I applied the exponential and the logarithm, this
          doesn't change the function, but this forms allows the use
          of the chain rule and then the product rule.

            \ln a) = e^{x \ln a} \ln a = a^x \ln a

          This derivative also makes use of the same exponential trick
          as the previous examples. In the chain rule step, the
          derivative of the inside function (which is <m>x \ln x</m>)
          requires the product rule.

      In the previous examples, I used the rule <m>\frac{d}{dx} \ln x = \frac{1}{x}</m>
      without justification. What is this justification?  The
      logarithm is the inverse of the exponential, which leads to
      thinking about the derivatives of inverse functions. There is a
      rule for such derivatives. I will write <m>x = f \circ
      f^{-1}(x)</m>, differentiate both sides using the chain rule,
      and rearrange to get an expression for <m>\frac{d}{dx}
      f^{-1}(x)</m>.

          Usually, when I differentiate, I get complicated
          expressions which I can't simplify into nice forms. Every
          now and then, there is an example that allows a very nice
          simplifcation. Consider this difficult derivative. I haven't
          annotated all the algebra here, but what I am doing is the
          first step is differentiating using linearity on the two
          pieces, then the product rule and the chainr rule of the
          first piece of the sum, and finally the chain rule followed
          by linearity followed by the chain rule again on the second
          piece of the sum. I've gone just to the derivative result
          and then done a bunch of algebraic manipulations to
          simplify, showing that the complicated result in this
          special case will condense down to something relatively
          elegant.

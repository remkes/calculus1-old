    <title>Academing Writing in Mathematics</title>
    <p>
      Writing a math assignment at the university lebel is a very
      different thing from your previous experience with mathematics
      assignments. In this section, I want to give some clear
      expectation on what I expect for academic writing in
      mathematics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of this sections follows from one basic idea.
      <blockquote>
        An assignment is a clear and professional presentation of
        <em>your own</em> arguments and ideas about a set of
        mathematical problems.
      </blockquote>
      In that context, these are my expectations for assignments
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Your assignments should be clean, legible and well organized.
        Don't hand in work with crossed-out sections or questions out
        of order. (This is part of what I mean by
        <em>professional</em> in the definition above.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't expect to hand in the paper that your start your work
        on. First work out your solutions in rough; then organize your
        solutions and write up a complete, clear and well-structure
        good copy to hand in.
      </li>
      <li>
        Annotate your calculations and explain your work. A string of
        calculations without any explanation is usually not
        sufficient. In the definition, I said that an assignment is
        your <em>argument</em>; arguments require words and sentences,
        not just mathematical symbols.
      </li>
      <li>
        As a starting rule-of-thump, most first and second year math
        assignments should be roughly 50% calculations and 50% words
        and sentences. 
      </li>
      <li>
        In the writing you do between your calculation, hold yourself
        to the same standards you would for any academic writing. Use
        complete sentences and strive for clear, concise and formal
        writing. 
      </li>
      <li>
        For the vast majority of your work, you can leave your answers
        in exact values. (For example, write <m>\sqrt{5}</m> instead
        of the approximate value <m>2.236</m>.) 
      </li>
      <li>
        When you use a computer algebra system or other technical tool
        for calculations, briefly indicate that you've done so. 
      </li>
      <li>
        If you use any external sources, you must reference them. This
        includes online courses, videos, and online discussion boards.
        I am not particular on what reference formatting you use: use
        any of the standard formats. (There will be more on this in
        <href ref="section-academic-honesty" />). 
      </li>
      <li>
        If you use a resource which introduces definitions or solution
        techniques that are different from what we use in this course,
        you need to explain those definitions or techniques and tell
        me why they apply to the question that I assigned. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Collaboration on assignments is strongly encouraged.
        However, you must write up your own version of the assignment
        after you have worked together to figure out a solution.
        Assignemnts from different students which have word-for-word
        identical sentences are not acceptable. (And recall that I
        expect assignments to have many sentences). 
      </li>
      <li>
        If you collaborated with other students in the course, please
        record who you worked with somewhere on the assignment. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Hand in your assignment when they are due. If a health or
        emergency situation prevents you from finishing your
        assignment, let me know (by email, preferably) as early as
        possible. 
      </li>
      <li>
        For assignments submitted online, submit a PDF scan of your
        assignment. Almost all mobile devices (phone, tablets) have
        easy ways to use their built-in cameras to scan documents. Try
        to find scanning methods that give reasonable file sizes. 
      </li>
    </ul>

    <title>Examples</title>
    <p>
      To help make these expectation clear, I have a number of
      examples of these expectations. In each of these examples,
      Solution 1 is technically correct but very poorly presented. I
      would not give full marks for this solutions. Solution 2
      contains the same technical details, but it must more clearly
      presented and includes references. Solution 2 would be give full
      marks. 
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve this system of equations. 
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Here is a technically correct but very poor answer. 
        </p>
      </solution>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Here is a annotated solution, which is much better.
        </p>
      </solution>

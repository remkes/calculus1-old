      A function is continuous at a point <m>a</m> in its domain if
      <me>
        f(a) = \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have already mentions these kinds of limit: in the calculation
      of limits, the first step was to try to evaluate the function at
      the limit point. In this step, I am implicitly relying on the
      continuity of the standard functions. Happily, I was
      justified in doing so: all the standard elementary functions
      (polynomials, rational function, algebraic functions, trig,
      exponentials) are continuous on their domains. The phrase
      <sq>on their domains</sq> is important; where there is a break
      in the domain, the function cannot be continuous. Continuity
      only happens inside the domain of a function. Visually, the
      graph of a continuous function is connected; it can be drawn
      without lifting your pen (pencil, chalk, etc).

    <title>Intermediate Value Theorem</title>
    <p>
      Though it has a formal name, the Intermediate Value Theorem is a
      very sensible and obvious result of continuity. Formally
      stated, the theorem says that if <m>f</m> is a continuous
      function on an interval <m>[a,b]</m> and <m>\alpha</m> is a real
      number with <m>f(a) \lt \alpha \lt f(b)</m> or <m>f(a) > \alpha
      > f(b)</m>, then there exists a number <m>c \in (a,b)</m> such
      that <m>f(c) = \alpha</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rephrased, the theorem says that a continuous function cannot
      skip any values. If <m>f(a) = 0</m> and <m>f(b) = 1</m>, then
      the function must output all values between <m>0</m> and
      <m>1</m> as the input goes from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m>.
      Continuity means the graph is connected; it can't jump over any
      intermediate values. While this seems like a very obvious
      result, it is quite useful to have it formally stated. Many
      other mathematical proofs make use of the Intermediate Value
      Theroem for continuous functions.

      All of the familiar elementary functions are
      continuous on their domains. One might ask: why worry
      about continuity at all? A common place where continuity
      becomes an issue is in piecewise functions. These are functions
      which have different expressions or definitions over different
      pieces of their domain. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Piecewise functions have special notation for their definitions. 
      Consider a function on <m>\RR</m> which has two definitions, one
      for <m>x \lt a</m> and another <m>x \geq a</m>. Then the
      function is written
      <me>
        f(x) = \begin{cases} g(x) \amp  x \lt  a \\ h(x) \amp
        x \geq a \end{cases} 
      </me>.
      With this notation, I can easily indicate how the function
      behaviours on various pieces of its domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very well-known example is the Heaviside function.
      <me>
        h(x) = \begin{cases} 0 \amp  x \lt  0 \\ 1 \amp  x
        \geq 0 \end{cases} 
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Heaviside function is very frequently used to model
      switches: it suddenly changes from off (0) to on (1) at
      <m>x=0</m>. This is a discontinuous change, as the function
      jumps from <m>0</m> to <m>1</m> without going through any
      intermediate value.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the definition of a piecewise function, there can be more
      than two pieces and the conditions on <m>x</m> can be more
      complicated than inequalities. Here is a piecewise function
      with three pieces defined on intervals.
      <me>
        f(x) = \begin{cases} x^2 -1 \amp  x \in (-5,0) \\ x^2
        + 1 \amp  x \in [0,3] \\ 3x-5 \amp  x \in (3,7) \end{cases}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The domain of this function is <m>(-5,7)</m>, which is the union
      of all the intervals of definition in the piecewise expression.
      It's graph is <xref
      ref="figure-discontinuous-piecewise">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Piecewise functions can be extremely strange.
      <me>
        f(x) = \begin{cases} 1 \amp  x \in \QQ \\ 0 \amp  x
        \notin \QQ \end{cases} 
      </me>
      This function depends on whether its input is rational or
      irrational, returning one and zero respectively. It is a
      horendously discontinuous functions, with ones and zeros
      everywhere and no intermediate values whatsoever. However, it is
      still a useful function, in that it, somehow, picks our all the
      rational numbers by assign to them the value <m>1</m>.

    <title>Continuity of Piecewise Functions</title>
    <p>
      It is important to be able to check if a piecewise function is
      continuous at its crossover point. Consider a piecewise
      function with a break at <m>x=a</m>.
      <me>
        f(x) = \begin{cases} g(x) \amp  x \lt  a \\ h(x) \amp
        x \geq a \end{cases} 
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is natural to ask if <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>x=a</m>.
      In order to investigate this, I need to look at the function
      value and the limits from both sides. The function is
      continuous if all three are the same.
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \rightarrow a^+} f(x)
        = f(a)

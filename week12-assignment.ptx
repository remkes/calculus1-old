        Consider this model of an tree population in a valley. 
        <m>t</m> is measured in years and the population is measured
        in millions. The model only applies for <m>t \geq 0</m>. (12)  
        <me>
          p(t) = \frac{x^2 - 7x - 3}{x^2 + 4x + 3} + 1

        <li>
          What is the starting population?
        </li>
        <li>
          What is the long term behaviour of the population?
        </li>
        <li>
          What is the maximum poluation and when does it occur?
        </li>
        <li>
          Qualitatively describe the year-to-year behaviour of the
          model. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Is this a reasonable population model? Why or why not?

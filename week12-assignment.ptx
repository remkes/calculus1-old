      Sketch this function. Include all eight steps described in the
      videos and the notes. (12) 
      <me>
        f(x) = \frac{2x^2 + 2x - 12}{x+3}

      <p>
        Assume that <m>f</m>, <m>g</m>, and <m>h</m> are all
        continuous function on <m>\RR</m> with <m> f(x) \leq g(x) \leq
        h(x)</m>. Assume that <m>f</m> only has three extrema:
        <m>f(-10) = -4</m> is a local minimum, <m>f(0) = 7</m> is a
        local maximum, and <m>f(10) = -6</m> is a local minimum.
        Assume that <m>h</m> also has only three extrema: <m>h(-10) =
        0</m> is a local minimum, <m>h(0) = 12</m> is a local maximum,
        and <m>h(10) = 1</m> is a local minimum. Assume also that the
        long term behaviour of both <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>, in both the
        positive directions, is unbounded growth. With these
        assumption, what can be said about the extrema of <m>g</m>?
        Draw some graphs to show the vareity of possible behaviours
        for <m>g</m> between these two other functions. (4)

        Consider this model of a population of lynx in a forest
        ecosystem, whree <m>t</m> is measured in years. 
        The model only applies for <m>t \geq 0</m>. (12)  
        <me>
          p(t) = e^{\frac{-1}{100}} \left( 5000 + 30 \sin (2 \pi t)
          \right)

        <li>
          What is the starting population?
        </li>
        <li>
          What is the long term behaviour of the population?
        </li>
        <li>
          How many critical points are there and when, roughly, do
          they occur.  (The calculation of the critical points is very
          difficult to do direction; I don't expect you to finish the
          calculation. Instead, start the calculation and make a
          conclusion simply about how often you will find a critical
          point and, very roughly, how they are spaced relatve to each
          other.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Qualitatively describe the year-to-year behaviour of the
          model. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Is this a reasonable population model? Why or why not?

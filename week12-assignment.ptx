      Sketch this function. Include all eight steps described in the
      videos and the notes. (12)

        Consider this model of an insect population. 
        <m>t</m> is measured in years. (10)  
        <me>
          p(t) = (10^8) e^{\frac{-1}{78}t} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{73} \sin
          (2\pi t) \right)

          What is the starting population?
        </li>
        <li>
          What is the long term behaviour of the population?
        </li>
        <li>
          Qualitatively describe the year-to-year behaviour of the
          model. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Is this a reasonable population model? Why or why not? What
          situations might create this population behaviour?
        </li>

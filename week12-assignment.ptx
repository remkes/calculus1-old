        Sketch the following function. (Make sure you complete all
        eight steps of the process from the course notes). (12) 
        <me>
          f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 3x + 1}{x+7}

        Consider the following model of population growth, where
        <m>p</m> is measured in millions and <m>t</m> is measured in
        years. (12)
        <me>
          p(t) = 39 + \frac{1}{15} t + 2^{-\frac{1}{14}t} 
        </me>

      <ol>
        <li><p>
          What is the starting population?
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          What is the long term behaviour of the population?
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          Wheni s the population at its maximum value? (Feel free to
          use a computer for the derivative and to solve for the
          critical points. Approximate values are fine here. You may
          assume that <m>t \in [0,\infty)</m>.)
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          Is this a reasonable population model? Why or why not?

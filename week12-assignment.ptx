      Sketch this function. (Do all eight steps listed in the videos
      and notes for this week. If you need to factor a cubic, you can
      ask a computer for the approximate roots.) (12)

        Consider this model of an ant population in some local
        ecosystem, where the population is simply numbers of ants and
        time is measured in months. (12) 
        <me>
          p(t) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} 
            30000 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{24}t} \amp t \in [0, 24) \\
            60000 \amp t \in [24, 48) \\
            10000 2^{-\frac{1}{2}t} \amp t \in [48, \infty) 
          \end{matrix} \right.

      <p><ol>
        <li>
          What is the starting population?
        </li>
        <li>
          Is the population function continuous? 
        </li>
        <li>
          What is the long term behaviour of the population?
        </li>
        <li>
          Is this a reasonable population model? Build a story that
          describes what is happening with this ant population.

      Consider this data set for a population (where <m>t</m> is counted
      in years). This growth looks exponential. We could apply
      exponential regression to find an exponential function, as in
      <xref ref="figure-exponential-regression">Figure</xref>. However,
      there is another way of finding a function to fit this model,
      using the growth rates to find a function to fit the data.
      Algebraic techniques have a hard time understanding growth rates,
      or rates of change in general. In calculus, we will develop a
      tool called the <em>derivative</em> of a function which will
      measure its rate of change. For now, we are going to avoid the
      technical definition but work with the idea. We need some
      notation. For a function <m>p(t)</m>, there are two common ways
      of writing the derivative.
      <me>
        p^\prime(t) \hspace{1cm} \frac{dp}{dt}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first notation is called Newton's notation, and the second is
      called Leibniz's notation. We will use both in this course but we
      will rely on Leibniz's notation most of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The derivative is the rate of change of the function, so for this
      model, <m>\frac{dp}{dt}</m> is the growth rate of the population.
      The average annual increase in the data above is <m>20</m>%
      growth. That means that the growth rate (the amount of population
      added in a year) is <m>\frac{20}{100}</m> (or <m>\frac{1}{5}</m>)
      times the current population. We can express this as an
      equation.
      <me>
        \frac{dp}{dt} = \frac{1}{5} p(t)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a mathematical translation of the understanding of
      percentage growth. An equation of this form, involving a function
      and its derivative, is called a <em>differential equation</em>
      (DE, in short). Very often in applied mathematics, it is easier
      to observe the rate of change of a function than the function
      itself. This leads to models expressed as differential equations.
      Many of the most important mathematical models in history are
      expressed as differential equations.

      The regression provided the function <m>p(t) =
      2^{\frac{t}{4}}</m>. We will see later in the course that the
      solution to this differential equation is a very similar
      function.
      <me>
        p(t) = e^{\frac{1}{5} t}

    <title>The Concept of a Differential Equation</title>
    <p>
      Solving differential equations is one of the major goals of
      calculus. The solution to this equation leads to the profound
      connection between percentage growth rate and exponential growth:
      if we observe a percentage growth rate, then the quantities we are
      observe should be described by an exponential function. This is
      how we know that many populations grow exponentially, as do
      functions involving resource use, radioactive decay, heat
      dissipation, debt repayment and investment interest. The
      importance of the exponential function is strongly related to its
      use as the solution to problems of percentage growth.

      DEs gives us a different approach to fiting a function to data.
      Instead of just using intuition to choose a class of functions and
      regression to get the specific function, we can look at the growth
      rates of the function in the data. If we can make a consistent
      observation about the growth rates, such as the observation that
      they grow by a consistent percentage, we can write that
      observation as a differential equation. We can then (hopefully)
      solve the differential equation to find the appropriate function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we worry about solving DEs, we simply want to understand
      what they say. Our goals is essentially translation: a
      differential equation is a mathematical translation of a statement
      about the growth rate of a quantity. We want to be able to pass
      both ways between the equation and the associated statement. We
      have seen how percentage growth with percentage <m>c</m>%
      translates into an equation. o
      <me>
        \frac{dp}{dt} = \frac{c}{100} p
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We can translate other statements as well. Percentage decay says
      that we loose a percentage <m>c</m>% of the quantity per unit
      time.
      <me>
        \frac{dp}{dt} = -\frac{c}{100} p
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Not all differential equations are percentage growth. Perhaps the
      rate of change is proportional to the square of the current
      value.
      <me>
        \frac{dp}{dt} = c(p(t))^2
      </me>

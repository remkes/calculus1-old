  <title>Limits at Finite Values</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In the prevous section, the two motivating problems of velocity
      and distance-travelled led us to approximation processes.
      Inside the field of algebra, we couldn't get exact answers to
      these problems, only approximate answers. However, algebra
      found a process for refining the approximation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calculus starts by asking if we can somehow calculate the end of
      an approximation processs. Is there an exact answer at the end
      of all the approximation? Calclulus uses a new tool, the limit,
      to find such an exact answer. A limit is a way of understanding
      an infinite process and asking where the process eventually
      leads. The limit is the key new tool that transcends algebra
      and creates calculus.

    <title>Definitions</title>
    <p>
      Our definition of limits will be restricted to limits of
      functions. In a limit, we are comparing the input and output of
      a function during an approximation process. The process starts
      with moving the input towards a specific value and observing
      what happens to the output.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>f(x)</m> be a function and <m>a</m> a point either in the
      domain of the function or on the boundary of its domain. Then
      the statement
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = L
      </me>
      means that as <m>x</m> (the input) gets closer and closer to
      <m>a</m>, f(x) (the output) gets closer and closer to <m>L</m>.
      If such an <m>L</m> exists, we say the limit of <m>f(x)</m>
      exists at <m>x=a</m>; we also say that the limit converges.
      Otherwise we say the limit diverges.

    </figure>
    <p>
      There are several ways in which the limit can diverge. The
      statement
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = \infty
      </me>
      means that as <m>x</m> gets closer and to <m>a</m>, the function
      value <m>f(x)</m> gets larger and larger without bound. The
      statement
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = -\infty
      </me>
      means that as <m>x</m> gets closer and to <m>a</m>, the function
      value <m>f(x)</m> becomes a larger and larger negative value
      without bound. The statement
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) \hspace{1cm} \text{ DNE }
      </me>
      means that the limit does not exist; it doesn't approach any
      number at all.

  <subsection xml:id="vertical-asymptotes">
    <title>Vertical Asymptotes</title>
    <p>
      For limits which approach <m>\pm \infty</m>, we see that the
      graph of the function approaches a verticle line. These lines
      are called <em>vertical asymptotes</em> for the functions.
      Vertical asymptotes are shown as the dotted lines in the <xref
      ref="figure-three-divergent-limits">Figure</xref>.

  <subsection xml:id="one-sided">
    <title>One-Sided Limits</title>
    <p>
      In the above definitions, we assume that <m>x \rightarrow a</m>
      means <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m> from both sides, considering
      <m>x</m> slightly larger and <m>x</m> slightly smaller than
      <m>a</m>. Sometimes it is convenient to only use one side.
      These are called one sided limits. If we want to approach from
      the left (from <m>x</m> slightly smaller than <m>a</m>), we
      adjust the limit notation slightly by writing <m>a^-</m>.
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a^-} f(x)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      If we want to approach from the right (from <m>x</m> slightly
      larger than <m>a</m>), we write <m>a^+</m>.
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a^+} f(x)

  <subsection xml:id="calculation-limits">
    <title>Calculating Limits</title>
    <p>
      There is a three step procedure to calculating limits.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            First, try to evaluate the function at the limit point.
            For reasonable funciton (specifically, continuous
            funcitons, which will be defined later), if the function
            can be evaluated directly, the function value will be your
            limit value.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If the first method fails, try to work out logically what
            the limit should do.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If both methods fail, the limit is called an
            <em>indeterminante form</em>. In this case, we need to
            use various algebraic tricks (factoring, expanding,
            multiplying by conjugates, trig identities) and rules for
            manipulating limits to change the limit into a more
            approachable form.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="limit-rules">
    <title>Limits Rules</title>
    <p>
      The third step referred to the rules for manipulating limits,
      which we will now state. Let <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> be functions
      with limits defined at <m>x=a</m> and let <m>c</m> be a
      constant. (In the quotient limit, assume <m>g(x) \neq 0</m>, and
      in the exponential limit, assume <m>f(x) > 0</m>.)

          \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) + g(x) \amp  = \lim_{x
          \rightarrow a} f(x) + \lim_{x \rightarrow a} g(x)

          \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) - g(x) \amp  = \lim_{x

          \frac{\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x)} {\lim_{x \rightarrow a}
          g(x)}

          \lim_{x \rightarrow a} (f(x))^c \amp  = (\lim_{x \rightarrow
          a} f(x))^c

      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the limit rules, there are two limits that are
      frequently useful. The second limit can be taken as a
      definition of the exponential base <m>e</m>.

          \amp  = e

    <title>Holistic Analysis of Models</title>
    <p>
      In the previous section, I combined many techniques from the
      whole course together in order to sketch curves. In this section,
      I will also be combining many areas of the course. The goal here
      is not visualization but interpretation: if there is a function
      which is a model of some real world phenomenon, I can use all the
      tools of calculus to understand what that model is saying. All of
      the information in curve sketching applies here, but I can also
      ask a number of questions that relate to the model.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            In addition to the mathematical domain, are there domain
            restrictions due to the model interpretation. (Very
            commonly, for example, the model measures only positive
            input values, so I restrict the domain to positive
            numbers.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Questions of intercepts are often questions of the starting
            value (y-intercept) or places where the model reaches zero
            values (x-intercepts).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Questions about vertical asymptotes tell me where the model
            reaches unreasonable values; perhaps this is where the model
            breaks down.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Questions about limits at <m>\infty</m> and horizontal
            asymptotes give me information about the long term behaviour
            of the model.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The derivative gives me the growth rate of the model.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I can ask for an interpretation of the constants in the
            model.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I can ask for a narrative: globally, qualitatively, what is
            the model saying?  How can I holistically describe the
            behaviour?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Finally, I can critique the model. Are there mathematical
            reasons (such as vertical asymptotes) where I expect the
            model may no longer fit the real world phenomenon?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      It's best to see this through examples. Unlike curve sketching,
      where I went through the same list deliberatively one item at a
      time, here I'll use which ever tools seem germaine to the model
      at hand.

    <title>Examples</title>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Conisder a model of radioactivity on a contaminated site,
          where radioactivity is measured as <m>r</m> in grays and
          <m>t</m> is time in years. This is the model.
          <me>
            r(t) = \begin{cases} 3 + \frac{5t^2}{10000} \amp t \leq 100
            \\ 2^{(-\frac{t}{100} + 4)} \amp t > 100 \end{cases} 
          </me>
        </p>
        <p><ul>
          <li>
            The domain of the model is <m>t \geq 0</m>, showing that
            observations start at year 0. The starting value at
            year 0 is <m>r(0) = 3</m> grays.
          </li>
          <li>
            The function is piecewise, but I can check that it is
            continuous at its cross-over point.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are no vertical asymptotes. The limit at
            <m>\infty</m> is 0, so <m>y=0</m> is a horizontal
            asymptote. That means the long term behaviour is a
            decay to negligable radiation.
          </li>
          <li>
            The derivative is positive on the first section <m>(0
            \leq t \leq 100)</m> and negative on the second
            section <m>(t > 100)</m>. Therefore, I expect a
            maximum at <m>t=100</m>. The radioactivity of the site
            is increasing for 100 years and decreasing at all
            times afterward.
          </li>
          <li>
            If safe level of radioactivity are under <m>5</m>
            grays, I can ask when the site is safe. To do so, I
            simply solve <m>r(t) = 5</m>. In approximate values,
            the site become unsafe at <m>t = 63.2</m> years and
            becomes safe again after <m>t = 167.8</m> years.
          </li>
          <li>
            As a narrative, qualitative summary, it looks like there
            is contamination that slowly increases the radioactivity
            over the first 100 years. At 100 years, something
            suddenly changes: either the contamination source is
            removed or some kind of cleaning process exists that
            removes contamination faster than it is added. From
            that point on, contamination decays, eventually dropping
            to near-zero levels.

        <p><ul>
          <li>
            A reasonable domain would be <m>t \geq 0</m>, assuming
            time starts at year 0.
          </li>
          <li>
            The function has exponential and sinusoidal pieces. It
            might be useful to look at them separately. The
            exponential piece is
            <me>
              p(t) = 100 e^{-t/10}
            </me>
            This is exponential decay which starts at <m>100</m>
            when <m>t=0</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            When I include the sine term, the coefficient infront of
            the exponential function varies between <m>90</m> and
            <m>110</m>. This will effect the trajectory of the
            exponential decay. However, since <m>10</m> is smaller
            than <m>100</m>, the effect is minimal. I would expect
            an exponential decay curve with small sinusoidal
            osscilation along its trajectory.
          </li>
          <li>
            The starting value is <m>p=100</m>. The longer term
            behaviour, in the limit, is <m>p=0</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The population is globally decreasing and decaying.
            However, due to the sinusoidal behaviour, there may be
            local small time frames where the population is briefly
            increasing. Since <m>t</m> is in years, perhaps this
            sinusoidal term measure seasonal variation in growth.

          Consider a model of temperature in a chemical reaction where
          <m>T</m> is in degree celcius and <m>t</m> is in minutes.
          This model is given by a differential equation. This is a
          relatively common situation: often in observations of the
          world, I can observe a differential equation instead of
          directly observing the function.
          <me>
            \frac{dT}{dt} = 6-6t
          </me>
          For this differential equation, I can just integrate to
          solve. That gives the function <m>T = -3t^2 + 6t + c</m>. To
          specify the function completely, I would need an initial
          temperature. Let's say that initial temperature is 12
          degrees: <m>T = -3t^2 + 6t + 12</m>
        </p>
        <p><ul>
          <li>
            This is a downward quadratic. If I complete the
            square, I get the vertex form: <m>T= -3(t^2 - 2t + 1) +
            15 = -3 (t-1)^2 + 15</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Therefore, there is a maximum at <m>t=1</m> minutes.
            That maximum is <m>T(1) = 15</m> degrees. The function
            rises in temperature for a minute, then starts to drop in
            a parabolic shape.
          </li>
          <li>
            The starting temperature, as given, is <m>T(0) = 12</m>
            degrees.
          </li>
          <li>
            The long term behaviour is <m>T \rightarrow -\infty</m>.
            However, this is obviously unreasonable. First, mostly
            likely there is an ambient temperature which the system
            will eventually reduce to. Second, even if this is
            happening in the vacuum of space, temperature is still
            bounded below at <m>-273</m> degrees. I conclude that
            this model is only meant to operate for relatively small
            <m>t</m>.

      The description of models is, in many ways, the culmulation of
      this course. For the majority of students in this calculus class,
      you will only use the techniques of calculus sparingly throughout
      your degree and in any future work. However, when you use these
      techniques, you are likely to be presented with functions
      describing some phenomena. I hope you now have some skills to
      look at those function and analyze their expected behaviour.

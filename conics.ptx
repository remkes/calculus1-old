    <title>Slicing a Cone</title>
    <p>
      The conics are the second important class of loci. Unlike lines,
      in conics we allow squares of the variables.
      Conics are a very old
      topic in mathematics; their names and definitions come from
      ancient Greece. They are called conics (short for conic
      sections) since they can be formed by taking slices of a hollow
      cone at various angles. We will give three equivalent
      definitions for each conic: one instrinsically geometric
      definition, one as a the slice of a cone, and one by algebraic
      equations. For the algebraic equations, we will assume that the
      conic is centred at the origin. (More general conics can be
      formed by shifting the conics centered at the origin. <xref
      ref="section-shifts" /> describes these shifts).

        <p>
          Given a positive real number <m>r</m>, a circle (centred at
          the origin) is the set of all points in the plane which are
          exactly <m>r</m> units away from the origin. <m>r</m> is
          called the radius of the cicle.

        <p>
          A circle is a perfectly horizontal slice of a cone.

        <p>
          Given two points <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> and a positive real
          number <m>r</m>, the ellipse is the set of all points in the
          plane where the sum of the distances to <m>p</m> and
          <m>q</m> is exactly <m>r</m>. The points are called the
          foci (singular focus).

        <title>Conic Slice Definition</title>
        <p>
          An ellipse is a slice of a cone at an angle greater than
          zero but less than the angle of the cone.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Algebraic Definition</title>
        <p>
          An ellipse (centred at the origin) is described by the
          equation <m>\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1</m>.
          Assuming that <m>a>b</m>, the foci are at
          <m>(\sqrt{a^2-b^2},0)</m> and <m>(-\sqrt{a^2-b^2},0)</m>.
          From the number <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, which ever is larger
          is called the semi-major axis which ever is smaller is
          called semi-minor axis. These two numbers cannot be equal,
          since that would give a circle.

        <title>Algebraic Definition</title>

    <p>
      One of the major motivating problems for conics and analytic
      geometry is the problem of celestial motion <mdash /> how
      planets, moons, stars, comets and other celestial objects move
      and orbit around each other. The Greeks assumed, erroneously,
      that orbits ought to be perfect circles. Johannes Kepler, in
      the 16th century, correctly observed that orbits take
      non-circular shapes. He put forward a very convincing theory
      that orbits have shapes which are conics with the larger object
      fixed at one of the foci of the conic. This leads to ellipses
      for objects without escape velocity and hyperbolas for those
      with escape velocity. Though not perfect (particularly in
      complicated multi-body problems or when relativistic corrections
      are included), Kepler's model is remarkably accurate. Conics
      are still used as the basic models of orbital paths.

    <title>Slicing a Cone</title>
    <p>
      The conics are the second important class of loci. Unlike lines,
      conic equations involve the squares of the variables.  Conics
      are a very old topic in mathematics; their names and definitions
      come from ancient Greece. They are called conics (short for
      conic sections) since they can be formed by taking slices of a
      hollow cone at various angles. I will give three equivalent
      definitions for each conic: one instrinsically geometric
      definition, one as a the slice of a cone, and one by algebraic
      equation. For the algebraic equations, I will assume that the
      conic is centred at the origin. (More general conics can be
      formed by shifting the conics centered at the origin. <xref
      ref="section-shifts" /> describes these shifts.)

          away from a fixed centre point. <m>r</m> is called the
          radius of the cicle.

          Given two points <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> and a positive real
          number <m>r</m>, the ellipse is the set of all points in the
          plane where the sum of the distances from a fixed center
          point to both <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> is exactly <m>r</m>. The
          points are called the foci (singular focus).

        <title>Conic Slice Definition</title>
        <p>
          An ellipse is a slice of a cone at an angle greater than
          zero but less than the angle of the cone.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Algebraic Definition</title>
        <p>
          An ellipse (centred at the origin) is described by the
          equation <m>\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1</m>.
          Assuming that <m>a>b</m>, the foci are at coordinates 
          <m>(\sqrt{a^2-b^2},0)</m> and <m>(-\sqrt{a^2-b^2},0)</m>.
          From the number <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, which ever is larger
          is called the semi-major axis which ever is smaller is
          called semi-minor axis. These two numbers cannot be equal,
          since that would produce a circle.

          A parabola (centred at the origin) is described by the

        <title>Another Algebraic Definition</title>
        <p>
          From your previous mathematical experience, you may be aware
          of another way of writing vertically-aligned parabolas. A
          common way to describe a parabola is by giving a vertex and
          a leading coefficient. The vertex is the peak of the
          parabola and the leading coefficient will describe how wide
          or narrow the parabola is. If the leading coefficient is
          positive, the parabola will open upwards; if negative, the
          parabola will open downwards. 
          A parabola with vertext <m>(a,b)</m> and leading coefficient
          <m>c</m> is described by the equation
           <m>y = c(x - a) + b</m>.

          number <m>r</m>, the hyperbola is the set of all points in
          the plane where the difference of the distances from a fixed
          centre point to <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> is exactly <m>r</m>.

        <title>Algebraic Definition</title>
        <p>
          A hyperbola (centred at the origin) is described by the

    <p>
      One of the major motivating problems for conics and analytic
      geometry is the problem of celestial motion <mdash /> how
      planets, moons, stars, comets and other celestial objects move
      and orbit around each other. The Greeks assumed, erroneously,
      that orbits ought to be perfect circles. Johannes Kepler, in
      the 16th century, correctly observed that orbits take
      non-circular shapes. He put forward a very convincing theory
      that orbits have shapes which are conics with the larger object
      fixed at one of the foci of the conic. This leads to ellipses
      for objects without escape velocity and hyperbolas for those
      with escape velocity. Though not perfect (particularly in
      complicated multi-body problems or when relativistic corrections
      are included), Kepler's model is remarkably accurate. Conics
      are still used as the basic models of orbital paths.

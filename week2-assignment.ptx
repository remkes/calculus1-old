        For each of the following situations, what kind of function
        might you choose to encode the dependence? Give reasons for
        your answer. (10)

        <li>
          Temperature of a cup of hot tea sitting in a room as a
          function of time. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Population of cicadas as a function of time. (Several types
          of cicada are well-known for a 17-year breeding cycle.) 
        </li>
        <li>
          Cost of oil depending on time.

          Rate of photosynthesis depending on the intensity of the
          sunlight.

        <li>
          Temperature of the ocean depending on lattitude.

        For each of the following functions, express the function as
        the composition of two other functions. (8)

        For the following pairs of functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>,
        calculate <m>f \circ g</m> and <m>g \circ f</m>. Simplify the
        expressions for the composition as much as you can. Then state
        the domains of <m>f \circ  g</m> and <m>g \circ f</m>. (15)

        Invert the following functions on the given domain. (You may
        assume the function is monotonic on the given domain). State
        the domain of the inverse. (12)

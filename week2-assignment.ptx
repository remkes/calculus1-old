        For each of the following situations, what kind of function
        might you choose to encode the dependence? Give reasons for
        your choices (6) 
        <ol>
          <li>
            Grade in a math class (in percentage) as a function of
            amount of time studied.   
          </li>
          <li>
            Happiness as a function of time spent in math lectures. 
          </li>

            Fear as a function fo time remaining until a math final
            exam.

        For the following pairs of functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>,
        calculate <m>f \circ g</m> and <m>g \circ f</m>. Simplify the
        expressions for the composition as much as you can. Then state
        the domains of <m>f</m>, <m>g</m>. <m>f \circ  g</m> and <m>g
        \circ f</m>. (18) 
        <ol>
          <li>
            <m>f(x) = x^2 + 7x</m> and <m>g(x) = \sin (x^2)</m>. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>f(x) = \ln \left( \frac{1}{1+x} \right)</m> and <m>g(x)
            = \frac{1}{x}</m>. 
          </li>
          <li>

        Invert the following functions on the given domain. (You may
        assume the function is monotonic on the given domain). State
        the domain of the inverse. (15) 
        <ol>
          <li>
            <m>f(x) = x^4 + 7</m> on the domain <m>[0,\infty)</m>.

          <li>
            <m>f(x) = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2+x} \right)</m> on the
            domain <m>[0,\infty)</m>. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>f(x) = \ln (x^2 - 2)</m> on the domain
            <m>(\sqrt{2},\infty)</m>.

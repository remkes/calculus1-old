        For each of the following situations, what kind of function
        might you choose to encode the dependence? Give reasons for
        your answer, but feel free to be honest, satirical or ironic
        as you see fit. (6)

        For the following pairs of functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>,
        calculate <m>f \circ g</m> and <m>g \circ f</m>. Simplify the
        expressions for the composition as much as you can. Then state
        the domains of <m>f</m>, <m>g</m>. <m>f \circ  g</m> and <m>g
        \circ f</m>. (18)

        Invert the following functions on the given domain. (You may
        assume the function is monotonic on the given domain). State
        the domain of the inverse. (15)

    <title>The Concept of a Model</title>
    <p>
      In this course, I use the term <sq>model</sq> in the broadest
      possible mathematical sense: a model is any application of a
      mathematical concept to an external situation.  Since calculus
      is the study of functions, models will be functions chosen
      to describe an observed connection between two quantities.  The
      branch of mathematics that deals with models is called applied
      mathematics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Models are the mathematical versions of a scientific hypothesis.
      If I observe a relationship between two quantities, choosing a
      function to describe that relationship is making a testable
      claim. I can work with the mathematics to understand
      the function. The behaviour of the function can be then tested
      against data, either the original data or new data. Finally, I
      can re-evaluate to see if the model fits the data to an
      acceptable precision. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The analysis of functions helps me to understand models. I can
      ask questions about functions inspired by their applied context.
      I'll start with three important questions.
    </p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>
        Do I need to restrict the domain to make the model reasonable?
        A mathematical model where the independent variable is human
        population would reasonably have a restriction that the
        population must be positive and bounded above by some maximum
        population. These restrictions of the model exist in addition
        to whatever natural mathematical restrictions we already have
        on domain.
      </li>
      <li>
        I can ask about starting values. If a model depends on time, I
        can set a starting time (often but not necessarily <m>t=0</m>)
        and specify a value for the function at the starting time.
        Even though there is a mathematical description of what
        happens before the starting time, I can ignore it since it
        doesn't apply to the situation I am modelling.
      </li>
      <li>
        I can ask about the constants in the model. Functions often
        involve constants apart from the variables, such at the
        coefficients of a polynomial. In a model, the constants should
        have reasonable meaning and interpretation.
      </li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>
      The analysis of models thus consists of everything I used to
      analyze functions in <xref ref="section-functions" /> and <xref
      ref="section-operations-on-functions" /> as well as these new
      questions. Often, I will also want a qualitative analysis of the
      model. Understanding the general shape and behaviour of the
      functions involved is invaluable to this qualitative analysis.
      A major goal for this course is to develop tools and
      competencies to allow students to analyze functions and models
      both quantitatively and qualitatively. The qualitative analysis
      can often be expressed in a narrative: what story is the
      function telling about the relationship it represents? If the
      independent variable is time, as it often is, what is the story
      of the dependant variable over a time span?  What happens to
      it?

    <title>Regression</title>
    <p>
      One of the greatest challenges of applied mathematics is
      choosing appropriate models. If the real world provides me with
      a set of data points, how do I choose a function? Often I can
      intuit what kind of function (linear, polynomial, exponential,
      etc) I think might fit the data. However, it is very difficult
      to be more specific just through intuition. Once I've chosen a
      type of function for the model, <em>regression</em> is a set of
      techniques that help to find the best specific function for the
      data. In this course, I will only be looking at regressions
      graphically. The hard work of calculating functions in a
      regression is left for future courses; regression is itself a
      major area of study in statistics.

    <title>The Concept of a Model</title>
    <p>
      In this course, we use the term <sq>model</sq> in the broadest
      possible mathematical sense: a model is any application of a
      mathematical concept to an external situation.  Since calculus
      is the study of functions, our models will be functions chosen
      to describe an observed connection between two quantities.  The
      branch of mathematics that deals with models is called applied
      mathematics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Models are the mathematical versions of the scientific method.
      If we observe a relationship between two quantities, choosing a
      function to describe that relationship is a scientific
      hypothesis.  We can then work with the mathematics to understand
      the function.  The behaviour of the function can be then tested
      against data, either the original data or new data.  We can
      re-evaluate to see if the model fits the data to an acceptable
      precision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our analysis of functions helps us understand models.  We can
      ask questions about functions inspired by their applied context.
      We'll start with three important questions.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Do we restrict the domain to make it reasonable?  A
            mathematical model where the independant variable is human
            population would reasonably impose restriction that the
            population must be positive and bounded above by some
            maximum population.  These restrictions of the model exist
            in addition to whatever natural mathematical restrictions
            we already have on domain.  
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We can ask abour starting values.  If our model depends on
            time, we can set a starting time (often but not
            necessarily <m>t=0</m>) and specify a value for the
            function at the starting time.  Even though there is a
            mathematical description of what happens before the
            starting time, we can ignore it since it doesn't apply to
            the situation we are modelling.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We can ask about the constants in our model.  Functions
            often involve constants apart from the variables, such at
            the coefficients of a polynomial.  In a model, the
            constants should have reasonable meaning and
            interpretation.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The analysis of models thus consists of everything we used to
      analyze functions in <xref ref="section-functions" /> and <xref
      ref="section-operations-on-functions" /> as well as these new
      questions. Often we will want a qualitative analysis of the
      model. Understanding the general shape and behaviour of the
      functions involved is invaluable to this qualitative analysis.
      A major goal for this course is to develop tools and
      competencies to allow students to analyze functions and models
      both quantitatively and qualitatively. The qualitative analysis
      can often be expressed in a narrative: what story is the
      function telling about the relationship? If the independant
      variable is time, as it often is, what is the story of the
      dependant variable over a time span?  What happens to it?

    <title>Regression</title>
    <p>
      One of the greatest challenges of applied mathematics is
      choosing appropriate models.  If the real world provides us with
      a set of data points, how do we choose a function?  Often we can
      intuit what kind of function (linear, polynomial, exponential,
      etc) we think might fit the data.  However, it is very difficult
      to be more specific just through intuition.  Once we've chosen a
      type of function for our model, <em>regression</em> is a set of
      techniques that help to find the best specific function for the
      data.  In this course, we will only be looking at regressions
      graphically.  The hard work of calculating functions in a
      regression is left for future courses.

      The simpliest kind of function is a constant function. Its
      output is the same regardless of input. The function <m>f(x) =
      5</m> is constant at 5: it will give the value 5 no matter what
      value of <m>x</m> we specify. Constant functions have no domain
      restrictions.

      Linear functions have the form <m>f(x) = ax + b</m> for real
      numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. Their graphs are straight
      lines, hence the name <sq>linear</sq>. Linear functions
      includes constant functions, since we allow <m>a=0</m>. All the
      tools from analytic geometry for understanding lines are useful
      for understanding linear functions. Linear functions have no
      domain restrictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A particularly important linear function is the function <m>f(x)
      = x</m>, which is called the <term>Identity Function</term>. It is
      the unique function which takes any input and gives that input
      back without any action.

      Quadratic functions have the form <m>f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c</m>.
      Their graphs are parabolas. We have a large array of tools to
      understand parabolas, including the vertex-form (to find the
      highest/lowest point of the function) and the quadratic equation
      (to find the roots). Quadratic functions have no domain

      Polynomial functions have the following form, where the

      <me>
        f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_2x^2 + a_1 x +
        a_0

    </p>
    <p>
      The number <m>n</m> of the largest power in the polynomial is
      called the <em>degree</em> of the polynomial. The previous
      cases are all polynomials: constant functions have degree zero,
      linear functions have degree one, and quadratics have degree
      two. We have names for the next few degress as well: cubics
      have degree three, quartics have degree four and quintics have
      degree five. Polynomial functions have a familiar standard
      shape involving a graph that curves up and down some number of
      times. The maximum number of times the graph of polynomial can
      change directions is one less than the degree. Polynomials of
      degree <m>n</m> can have at most <m>n</m> roots, though they may
      have fewer. Polynomial functions have no domain restrictions.

      Rational numbers are fractions involving integers, In the same
      way, rational functions are fractions involving polynomials.
      Rational functions have the follwoing form, where <m>p(x)</m>
      and <m>q(x)</m> are polynomials.

        f(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}

      Rational functions may have domain restrictions. In order to
      avoid dividing by zero, I must avoid any <m>x</m> where <m>q(x)
      = 0</m>. Rational functions may have <term>vertical
      asymptotes</term> near their undefined points. A vertical
      asymptote is a vertical line which the graph of the function
      approaches near an undefined point; they will be discussed in
      more detail in <xref ref="subsection-vertical-asymptotes" />.

      I am now moving into much broader categories of functions, where
      it is impossible to give a simple cohesive sense of the
      behaviour of the functions. However, terminology is still useful
      for grouping these functions. Algebraic functions are functions
      which involve the four basic operations of addition,
      subtraction, multiplication and division as well as any rational
      exponent. This includes polynomials and rational functions, but
      also roots, since roots can be written as fractional exponents.
      (<m>\sqrt{x} = x^{\frac{1}{2}}</m>). Algebraic functions can be
      very complicated conglomerations of these operations.

      The first type of non-algebraic functions I want to present are
      trigonometric functions. Sine and cosine have the familiar
      sinusoidal wave shape: infinitenly many oscillations which repeat
      perfectly with some period. Sine and cosine waves can be
      analyzed by their amplitude and period. The other trigonometric
      functions (tangent, cotangent, secant and cosecant) are also
      periodic, but they have undefined points and vertical asymptotes
      at regular intervals.

      Though the trigonometric functions are usually associated to
      triangles, it is more natural to define them using the circle.
      If <m>\theta</m> is the angle from the positive <m>x</m> axis,
      then <m>\cos \theta</m> is exactly the <m>x</m> coordinate of
      the point on circle determined by <m>\theta</m> and <m>\sin
      \theta</m> is exactly the <m>y</m> coordinate. All of the
      important properties of trigonometric functions can be derived
      from circle geometry, including the many trigonometric
      identities. Please see the reference materials for
      definitions and identities involving trigonometric functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each trigonometric function has a inverse function. There are
      two standard notations; the inverse of <m>\sin(x)</m> is written
      either as <m>\sin^{-1}(x)</m> or <m>\arcsin(x)</m>. Even though
      the former notation is familiar from calculators, I will use
      the latter in these notes to avoid confusions with
      <m>\frac{1}{\sin(x)}</m>. (The reciprocal of a trig function is
      not the same as the inverse of a trig function.)

      If <m>a</m> is a positive real number, then functions of the
      form <m>f(x) = a^x</m> are called exponential functions. They
      differ from roots and polynomials in that the variable is in the
      exponent. This distinction is very important but easy to
      confuse: <m>f(x) = x^a</m> is an algebraic function but <m>f(x)
      = a^x</m> is an exponential function, which is not algebraic.
      The laws of exponents (see the reference material) are very
      useful for working with exponential functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exponential bases you've most likely seen to date have been
      2 and 10. These are useful bases, but in calculus (for reasons
      that will become clear later) a different base is prefered. The
      irrational number <m>e</m> is called Euler's number. It has an
      approximate value <m>e = 2.71828\ldots</m>. It is by far the
      most common exponential base; you will be seeing the exponential
      function <m>f(x) = e^x</m> very frequently. It is reasonable to
      claim that <m>f(x) = e^x</m> is the most important function in
      calculus.

      The inverse of the exponential function is the logarithm. If
      the exponential has base <m>a</m>, its logarithm is written
      <m>\log_a x</m>. However, the inverse of the exponential
      <m>f(x) = e^x</m> is instead written <m>\ln x</m> and called the
      natural logarithm. Like <m>e^x</m> over other exponential
      functions, the natural logarithm is by far the most commonly
      used logarithm in calculus. All logarithms have a domain
      restrictions: they can only act on (strictly) positive numbers.

      Though I won't define or investigate these function until
      Calculus II, it is useful to mention that there is a third
      important family of non-algebraic functions called the
      hyperbolic functions. There are a strange family, in some ways
      similar to trigonometric functions and in some ways similar to
      exponentials. They have inverse functions as well, called the

      Everything I've defined so far comes together to form the large
      family refered to as the elementary functions.  Everything I've
      defined so far, as well as any combination of these functions,
      is an elementary function. These functions are sufficient for a
      wide variety of useful applications, and form the core of
      calculus and many other parts of applied mathematics. However,
      calculus also gives tools to create many other kinds of
      non-elementary functions. Depending how far you progress in the
      stream of calculus courses, you may encounter some of these
      non-elementary functions.

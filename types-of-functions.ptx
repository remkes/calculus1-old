  <title>Types of Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We want to give a catalog of the common types of functions we
      encounter in calculus.
    </p>

    <title>Constant Functions</title>

    <p>
      The simpliest kind of function is a constant function. Its
      output is the same regardless of input. The function <m>f(x) =
      5</m> is constant at 5: it will give the value 5 no matter what
      value of <m>x</m> we specify  Constant functions have no domain
      restrictions.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="linear-functions">
    <title>Linear Functions</title>
    <p>
      Linear functions have the form <m>f(x) = ax + b</m> for real
      numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. Their graphs which are straight
      lines, hence the name <sq>linear</sq>. Linear functions
      includes constant functions, since we allow <m>a=0</m>. All the
      tools from analytic geometry for understanding lines are useful
      for understanding linear functions. Linear functions have no
      domain restrictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A particularly important linear function is the function <m>f(x)
      = x</m>, which is called the <em>Identity Function</em>. It is
      the unique function which takes any input and gives that input
      back without any action.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="quadratic-functions">
    <title>Quadratic Functions</title>
    <p>
      Quadratic functions have the form <m>f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c</m>.
      Their graphs are parabolas. We have a large array of tools to
      understand parabolas, including the vertex-form (to find the
      highest/lowest point of the function) and the quadratic equation
      (to find the roots). Quadratic functions have no domain
      restrictions.

      <image width="85%" source="images/figure28"/>
    </figure>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="polynomials">
    <title>Polynomial Functions</title>
    <p>
      Polynomial functions have the following form, where the
      <m>a_i</m> are anyreal numbers.
      <me>
        f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_2x^2 + a_1 x + a_0
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The number <m>n</m> of the largest power in the polynomial is
      called the <em>degree</em> of the polynomial. The previous
      cases are all polynomials: constant functions have degree zero,
      linear functions have degree one, and quadratics have degree
      two. We have names for the next few degress as well: cubics
      have degree three, quartics have degree four and quintics have
      degree five. Polynomial functions have a familiar standard
      shape involving a graph that curves up a down some number of
      times. The maximum number of times the graph of polynomial can
      change directions is one less than the degree. Polynomials of
      degree <m>n</m> can have at most <m>n</m> roots, though they may
      have fewer. Polynomial functions have no domain restrictions.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="rational-functions">
    <title>Rational Functions</title>
    <p>
      Rational numbers are fractions involving integers, In the same
      way, rational functions are fractions involving polynomials.
      Rational functions have the follwoing form, where <m>p(x)</m>
      and <m>q(x)</m> are polynomials.
      <me>
        f(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Rational functions may have domain restrictions. Into order to
      avoid dividing by zero, we must avoid <m>x</m> where <m>q(x) =
      0</m>. Rational functions may have <em>vertical asymptotes</em>
      near their underfined points. A vertical asymptote is a vertical
      line which the graph of the function approaches near an
      undefined point.

  <subsection xml:id="algebraic-functions">
    <title>Algebraic Functions</title>
    <p>
      We are now moving into much broader categories of functions,
      where it is impossible to give a cohesive sense of the behaviour
      of the functions. Terminology is still useful for grouping
      these functions. Algebraic functions are functions which
      involve the four basic operations of addition, subtraction,
      multiplication and division as well as any real exponent. This
      includes polynomials and rational functions, but also roots,
      since roots can be written as fractional exponents.
      (<m>\sqrt{x} = x^{\frac{1}{2}}</m>). Algebraic functions can be
      very complicated conglomerations of these operations.

  <subsection xml:id="trig-functions">
    <title>Trigonometric Functions</title>
    <figure xml:id="figure-trigonometric-function">

    </figure>
    <p>
      The first type of non-algebraic functions are trigonometric
      functions. Sine and cosine have the familiar sinusoidal wave
      shape: infinitenly many oscilation which repeat perfectly with
      some period. Sine and cosine waves can be analyzed by their
      amplitude and period. The other trigonometric functions
      (tangent, cotangent, secant and cosecant) are also periodic, but
      they have undefined points and vertical asymptotes at regular
      intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the trigonometric functions are usually associated to
      triangles, it is more natural to define them using the circle.
      If <m>\theta</m> is the angle from the positive <m>x</m> axis,
      then <m>\cos \theta</m> is exactly the <m>x</m> coordinate of
      the circle and <m>\sin \theta</m> is exactly the <m>y</m>
      coordinate of the circle. All of the important properties of
      trigonometric functions can be derived from circle geometry,
      including the many trigonometric identities. Please see the
      formlua reference sheet for definitions and identities involving
      trigonometric functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each trigonometric function has a inverse function. There are
      two standard notations; the inverse of <m>\sin(x)</m> is written
      either as <m>\sin^{-1}(x)</m> or <m>\arcsin(x)</m>. Even though
      the former notation is familiar from calculators, we will use
      the latter in these notes to avoid confusions with
      <m>\frac{1}{\sin(x)}</m>.

  <subsection xml:id="exponential-functions">
    <title>Exponential and Logarithmic Functions</title>
    <figure xml:id="figure-an-exponential-function">

      <image width="85%" source="images/figure31"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      If <m>a</m> is a positive real number, then functions of the
      form <m>f(x) = a^x</m> are called exponential functions. They
      differ from roots and polynomials in that the variable is in the
      exponent. This distinction is very important but easy to
      confuse: <m>f(x) = x^a</m> is an algebraic function but <m>f(x)
      = a^x</m> is an exponential function, which is not algebraic.
      The laws of exponents (see the formula sheets) help us work with
      exponential functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exponential bases you've most likely seen to date have been
      2 and 10. These are useful bases, but in calculus (for reasons
      that will become clear later) we prefer a different base. The
      irrational number <m>e</m> is called Euler's number. It has an
      approximate value <m>e = 2.71828\ldots</m>. It is by far the
      most common exponential base; you will be seeing the exponential
      function <m>f(x) = e^x</m> very frequently. It is reasonable to
      claim that <m>f(x) = e^x</m> is the most important function in
      calculus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inverse of the exponential function is the logarithm. If
      the exponential has base <m>a</m>, its logarithm is written
      <m>\log_a x</m>. However, the inverse of the exponential
      <m>f(x) = e^x</m> is instead written <m>\ln x</m> and called the
      natural logarithm. We will almost exclusively deal with the
      natural logarithm in calculus. Logarithms (in any base) can
      only act on positive numbers.

  <subsection xml:id="hyperbolic-functions">
    <title>Hyperbolic Functions</title>
    <p>
      Though we won't define or investigate these function until
      Calculus II, it is useful to mention that there is a third
      important family of non-algebraic functions called the
      hyperbolics functions. There are a strange family, in some ways
      similar to trigonometric functions and in some ways similar to
      exponentials. They have inverse functions as well, called the
      inverse hyperbolics.

    <p>
      Everything we've defined so far comes together to form the large
      family refered to as the elementary functions. We can think of
      elementary functions as those function for which we have a
      familiar and succinct notation. Everything we've defined so
      far, as well as any combination of these functions, is an
      elementary function. As we will see later, calculus gives us
      methods for defining many non-elementary functions. Depending
      on how far you proceed through the calculus stream, you will see
      a few or many of these non-elementary functions.

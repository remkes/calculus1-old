  <title>Determining Asymptotic Order</title>
  <p>
    In quotient limits,
    <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> may be more complicated than the simple functions in our asymptotic ranking.
    We have a two useful rules to help us work with <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> which are combinations of pieces of various asymptotic order.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>f = f_1 + f_2 + f_3 + \ldots + f_n</m> then the asymptotic order of <m>f</m> is the maximum of the asymptotic order of the <m>f_i</m>.
          This means that in a sum or difference,
          we only need to consider the fastest growing pieces.
          We can simply ignore all the rest.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>f_1 \lt g_1</m> and either
          <m>f_2 \lt g_2</m> or <m>f_2</m> and <m>g_2</m> have the same asymptotic order,
          then <m>f_1 f_2 \lt g_1 g_2</m>.
          Basically, this says that relationships of asymptotic order are preserved in products.

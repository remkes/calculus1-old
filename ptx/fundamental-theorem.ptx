  <title>The Fundamental Theorem</title>
  <p>
    As mentioned above, we need a way to avoid using the definition.
    With derivative,
    we just developed a series of rules for various types and combinations of functions.
    That doesn't work as easily or cleanly for integrals.
    However, there is a very powerful theorem that gives us an approach to solving integrals.
  </p>
  <p>
    To state the theorem, we need to consider a strange new function.
    For <m>g(t)</m> continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> and <m>x \in [a,b)</m>,
    define a new function <m>f</m>.
    <me>
      f(x) := \int_a^x g(t) dt
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's give some interpretation:
    <m>f(x)</m> is the area under the function <m>g(t)</m> along the <m>t</m> axis between a fixed point <m>t=a</m> and a varying endpoint <m>x</m>.
    Be careful to keep the variables straight!
    The variable <m>t</m> is only inside the integral and the variable <m>x</m> is only outside.
    <m>x</m> is the endpoint of the interval and <m>t</m> is the variable that goes between <m>a</m> and <m>x</m> on the interval.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though very strange,
    this definition is a rich source of new and interesting functions in mathematics.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{ Fresnel }   \amp  S(x) := \int_0^x \sin \left(\frac{\pi t^2}{2}
        \right) dt</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{ Logarithmic Integral }   \amp  \text{ li } (x) = \int_0^x
        \frac{dt}{\ln t}</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{ Sine Integral }  \amp   Si(x) = \int_0^x \frac{\sin t}{t} dt</mrow>
      </md>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    Now that we have this function <m>f(x)</m>,
    we can look at its derivative.
    <xref ref="figure-area-function">Figure</xref> gives a useful visualization.
    In the figure,
    we've labelled a point <m>x</m> and a small increase <m>x+h</m>.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="figure-area-function">
    <caption>The Area Function <m>f(x)</m></caption>
    <image width="1000%" source="images/figure53.png" />
  </figure>
  <p>
    We use the limit definition of the derivative.
    <me>
      \frac{d}{dx} f(x) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Since <m>f</m> measures area,
    the difference <m>f(x+h) - f(x)</m> is just the area of the very thin rectangle in <xref ref="figure-area-function">Figure</xref>.
    When <m>h</m> is small,
    this area is roughly the height <m>g(x)</m> times the width <m>h</m>.
    <me>
      \frac{d}{dx} f(x) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{g(x) h}{h} = g(x)
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    All this work can be summarized in the following statement,
    which is called the <em>Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</em>.
    <me>
      \frac{d}{dx} f(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \int_a^x g(t) dt = g(x)
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    The important implication of the fundamental theorem is this:
    integral and derivatives are opposite operations.
    In the previous statement, we start with a function <m>g</m>,
    take and integral to get <m>f</m> and then take a derivative to get back to <m>g</m>.
    Derivatives and integrals are reverse processes.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are several versions of the fundamental theorem,
    but they all capture this basic idea of reserve processes.
    The derivative can be inside the integral.
    <me>
      \int_a^b f^\prime(t) dt = f(b) - f(a)
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    This version of the fundamental theorem gives us a wonderful way to calculate definite integrals.
    Let <m>F</m> be any function such that <m>F^\prime(x) = f(x)</m>.
    Such a function <m>F</m> is called an
    <em>antiderivative</em> for <m>f</m>.
    We use antiderivatives to evaluated integrals.
    <me>
      \int_a^b f(t) dt = F(b) - F(a)
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    To calculate antiderivatives,
    we need to do deriavitves backwards.
    Fortunately,
    this is much easier than using the definition of the integral;
    it will become our main strategy for integrals.
    Unfortunately, it is still reasonably difficult.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's useful to have a notation for antiderivatives.
    Since integrals are, in some way, the inverse operation,
    it seems natural to use an integral symbol to indicate an antiderivative.
    We drop the bounds that we used for definition integrals.
    <me>
      \text{ Any antiderivative of f is written }  \int f(x) dx
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is called an indefinite integral.
    Note that the notation means <em>all</em> anti-derivatives,
    since there may be more than one.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In these examples, I'm using what I know about derivatives to do the operation backwards.
        The sixth example is just the power rules done backwards.
        The proofs of all of these are easy:
        just differentiate the right side of the equation.
        Since they are anti-derivatives,
        the derivative of the right side should give the original function on the left
        (inside the integral sign).
        The <m>+C</m> is an arbitrary constant which we must add.
        It shows up because it would disappear in differentiation.

        We can use the fundamental theorem to calculate definite integrals as well.
        There is some special notation that is useful here:
        when we write <m>\left. f(x) \right|_a^b</m> we mean to evaluate <m>f</m> at <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> and subtract.
        <me>
          \left. f(x) \right|_a^b = f(b) - f(a)
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        The antiderivative of <m>x^2</m> is <m>\frac{x^3}{3}</m>.
        <me>
          \int_2^4 x^2 dx = \left. \frac{x^3}{3} \right|_2^4 = \frac{4^3}{3} - \frac{2^3}{3} = \frac{64 - 8}{3} = \frac{56}{3}
        </me>

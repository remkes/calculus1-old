  <title>Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In order to define functions, we need to define sets.
      A <em>set</em> is any collection of things;
      the things in a set are called its <em>elements</em>
      While most of our sets will be sets of numbers,
      apriori a set can have any kind of elements.
      Particularly useful sets for this course are the standard number sets (<m>\NN</m>,
      the natural numbers;
      <m>\ZZ</m>, the integers;
      <m>\QQ</m>, the rational number,
      <m>\RR</m>, the real numbers),
      open inverals <m>(a,b)</m> and closed interval <m>[a,b]</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be sets.
      A <em>function</em> <m>f: A \rightarrow B</m> is a rule that assigns an element of <m>B</m> to each element of <m>A</m>.
      The set <m>A</m> is called the domain.
      The range of the function is the subset of <m>B</m> consisting of all outputs of the function.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three major interpretations of functions.
      First, we can think of a function as a machine which acts on things.
      The function <m>f(x) = x^2</m> from
      <m>\RR \rightarrow \RR</m> is a rule which assignes to each number its square.
      However, it's often more natural to think of <m>f</m> as the thing that squares numbers.
      Functions are agents which perform actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, we think of functions as relationships and dependencies.
      When we have a function <m>f: A \rightarrow B</m>,
      we can thing of the elements of <m>B</m> depending on the elements of <m>A</m>.
      If we say that population growth is a function of food supply,
      we mean that there is a function which goes from numbers representing food suply to numbers representing growth rates.
      That function encodes the dependance of growth on food supply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, we often visualize a function by its graph.
      See the library of functions reference sheet for graphs of many common functions.
      Visualizing the action of a function by its graph is a very convenient way to remember the function and its properties.

    <title>Functions on <m>\RR</m></title>
    <p>
      For the purposes of calculus,
      we will deal with functions defined on <m>\RR</m> and its subsets.
      For most functions, we will not explicitly stipulate a domain;
      the domain of the function will implicitly be the largest subset of real numbers where the function applies.
      Likewise the range will be the subset of all possible outputs of the function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Determining the domain of a function on <m>\RR</m> means avoiding illegal mathematical actions.
      There are three common restrictions.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            We cannot divide by zero.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We cannot take even roots of negative numbers.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We cannot take logarithms of negative numbers or zero.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are special domain restrictions for certain functions,
      such as inverse trig functions,
      but the main three cover the vast majority of functions we will be dealing with.
      Determining the domain of a function <m>f</m> means excluding real numbers which would lead to one of the three problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, should we wish to,
      we can put additional domain restrictions on a function.
      Functions of time cannot extend infinitely back in time,
      so we usually stipulate a starting time;
      the domain of the function will be after that starting time.
      Restricting domains is also useful to make a function invertible.

    <title>Equations of Tangent Lines</title>
    <p>
      By definition,
      a derivative is the slope of a tangent line to a function.
      Therefore, once we can calculate derivatives using the rules of the previous sections,
      we can calculate equations of tangent lines.
      We'll demonstrate this by two examples.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The point <m>(2,4)</m> is on the parabola <m>y = x^2</m>,
          which is the graph of the function <m>f(x) = x^2</m>.
          The derivative of the function is <m>f^{\prime}(x) = 2x</m>.
          The derivative evaluated at <m>x=2</m> is <m>f^{\prime(2)} = 2(2) = 4</m>,
          which tells us the slope of the tangent line at the point <m>(2,4)</m> is <m>4</m>.
          Now we have a point and slope;
          by the review we did at the very start of these notes,
          we can determine the equation of the tangent line.
          All we have left to do is find the <m>y</m> intercept.
          <md>
            <mrow>y \amp  = mx + b</mrow>
            <mrow>4 \amp  = (4)(2) + b \implies b = 4 - 8 = -4</mrow>
            <mrow>y \amp  = 4x - 8</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          The tangent line to the function
          <m>f(x) = x^2</m> at the point <m>(2,4)</m> is the line <m>y = 4x-8</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The point <m>(9,3)</m> is on the graph of the function <m>f(x) = \sqrt{x}</m>.
          The derivative of the function is <m>f^{\prime}(x) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}</m>.
          If we input the value <m>x=9</m>,
          we get <m>f^{\prime}(9) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{9}} = \frac{1}{6}</m>.
          Now we have a slope and a point,
          so we can calculate the equation of the tangent line by finding the <m>y</m> intercept.
          <md>
            <mrow>y \amp  = mx + b</mrow>
            <mrow>3 \amp  = \frac{1}{6} 9 + b \implies b = 3 - \frac{9}{6} = 3 - \frac{3}{2} = \frac{3}{2}</mrow>
            <mrow>y \amp  = \frac{x}{6} + \frac{3}{2}</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          The tangent lien to the function
          <m>f(x) = \sqrt{x}</m> at the point <m>(9,3)</m> is the line <m>y = \frac{x}{6} + \frac{3}{2}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

    <title>Implicit Derivatives</title>
    <p>
      So far, we've looked for the slopes of tangent lines to the graphs of functions.
      We could consider a broader category of geometric loci in <m>\RR^2</m> where we want to find tangents lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an archetypical example, consider the unit circle <m>x^2 + y^2 =1</m>.
      Obviously, this smooth curve should have tangent lines with well-defined slopes and equations How do we find them?
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="figure-tangent-lines-circle">
      <caption>Tangent Lines to the Circle</caption>

    </figure>
    <p>
      The technique for finding these slopes is a technique called implicit differentiation.
      The circle <m>x^2 + y^2 = 1</m> isn't the graph of a function.
      Implicit differentiation pretends
      (at least, locally)
      that it is the graph of a function where <m>y</m> depends on <m>x</m>.. With that pretense,
      differentiating any expression involving <m>x</m> happens as usual.
      However, differentiating any expression involving <m>y</m> requires the chain rule.
      If <m>y</m> is (implicity) a function of <m>x</m>,
      then the expression <m>g(y)</m> uses the chain rule.
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dx} g(y) = g^\prime(y) \frac{dy}{dx}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we take the equation <m>x^2 + y^2 = 1</m> and differentiate both sides.
      We will get a <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> term our of the implicit differentiation of <m>y</m>,
      which we will try to isolate.
      <md>
        <mrow>x^2 + y^2 \amp  = 1</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{d}{dx} x^2 + y^2 \amp  = \frac{d}{dx} 1</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{d}{dx} x^2 + \frac{d}{dx} y^2 \amp  = 0</mrow>
        <mrow>2x + 2y \frac{dy}{dx} \amp  = 0</mrow>
        <mrow>2y \frac{dy}{dx} \amp  = -2x</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{dy}{dx} \amp  = \frac{-x}{y}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      This gives us an expression for the slope of the tangent line to a circle.
      Notice that the expression involves both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>:
      that is to be expected.
      We can evaluate it on any point <m>(x,y)</m> which lies on the circle.
      To get the lines in the previous diagram,
      we evaluate at <m>(0,1)</m> to get a slope of <m>0</m> and at
      <m>\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)</m> to get a slope of <m>1</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This works for most of the circle,
      but the expression is undefined when <m>y=0</m>.
      We can't find the slope of the tangent line at <m>(1,0)</m> or <m>(-1,0)</m>.
      By looking at the shape, this makes sense for two reasons.
      First, the tangent lines are becoming steeper and steeper approaching this point:
      it's reasonable to conclude that they are actually vertical at <m>(\pm 1,0)</m>.
      A vertical line doesn't have a well defined slope.
      The second reason is equally as important.
      Recall we assumed that (locally) <m>y</m> was a function of <m>x</m>.
      This is a reasonable assumption everywhere except near <m>(\pm 1,0)</m>.
      At these points, the circle doubles-back on itself.
      If we zoom in on this point of the circle,
      we always get a locus that would fail a vertical line test,
      thus cannot be the graph of a function.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, there are three ways in which implicit differentiation can fail.
      The first is for discontinuities or sharp corners,
      as with ordinary derivatives.
      The second is where we have vertical tangents and the slope is undefined.
      The third is due to places where the assumption that <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m> breaks down.
      However, even with these restrictions,
      implicit differentiation is a powerful technique.

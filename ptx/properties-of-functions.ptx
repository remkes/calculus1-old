  <title>Properties of Functions</title>
  <p>
    We use a number of properties of functions to describe their behaviour.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <em>domain</em> of a function is all possible real inputs to the function.
          The domain can be restricted to a smaller subset if desired.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <em>range</em> of a function is all possible real outputs of the function.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A function is <em>even</em> if <m>f(-x) = f(x)</m>.
          Visually, the graph of the function has a mirror-image symmetry over the <m>y</m> axis.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A function is <em>odd</em> if <m>f(-x) = -f(x)</m>.
          Visually, the graph of the function is the preserved under a half-turn rotation about the origin.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A function is <em>periodic</em>
          if there is a real number <m>a</m> such that <m>f(x+a) = f(a)</m> for all <m>x</m>.
          The smallest positive real number <m>a</m> that satisfies is called the period.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A function is called <em>increasing</em>
          if <m>a\lt b</m> implies <m>f(a) \lt f(b)</m>.
          Visually, the graph of the function is growing upwards as the input increases.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A function is called <em>decreasing</em>
          if <m>a\lt b</m> implies <m>f(a) > f(b)</m>.
          Visually, the graph of the function is declining downwards as the input increases.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A function is called <em>monotonic</em>
          if it is either always increasing or always decreasing.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A function is <em>bounded above</em>
          if there is a number <m>A</m> such that <m>f(x) \lt A</m> for all <m>x</m>.
          Visually, the graph of the function never gets above the height <m>y=A</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A function is <em>bounded below</em>
          if there is a number <m>B</m> such that <m>f(x) > B</m> for all <m>x</m>.
          Visually, the graph of the function never gets below the height <m>y=B</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A function is <em>bounded</em> if it is both bounded above and below.
          That is, there exists numbers <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> such that <m>B \lt f(x) \lt A</m> for all <m>x</m>.
          Visually, the function remains within the range <m>y \in [A,B]</m> for any input.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A <em><m>y</m>-intercept</em> of a function is a place where it crosses the <m>y</m> axis.
          Since a function satisfies a vertical line test,
          there is only one possible <m>y</m> intercept found at <m>f(0)</m>
          (if <m>0</m> is in the domain).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          An <em><m>x</m>-interceopt</em> or <em>root</em>
          of a function is a place where it crosses the <m>x</m> axis or,
          equivalently,
          has the output <m>f(x) = 0</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <title>Indeterminate Forms</title>
    <p>
      Recall that a limit is called an
      <em>indeterminate form</em>
      if it cannot be evaluated or logically determined.
      We can classify indeterminate forms by their type.
      For now, we look at three types.
      The first two types involve quotient limits.
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> approach <m>\pm \infty</m>,
      the limit is called an indeterminate form of type <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m>.
      If instead both <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> approach <m>0</m>,
      then it is an indeterminate form of type <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>.
      In both cases,
      we want to use algebra to factor out and cancel off the pieces of the quotients which tends to <m>\infty</m> or <m>0</m> to solve the limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third type involves a difference limit.
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) - g(x)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      If both <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> approach <m>\pm \infty</m>,
      this limit is called an indeterminate form of type <m>\infty - \infty</m>.
      For this type, we want to use common denominator,
      conjugates or other algegraic tricks to reduce it to a limit of type
      <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m> or type <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all these definitions,
      we could replace <m>x \rightarrow a</m> with the one-sided limit or <m>x \rightarrow \pm \infty</m>;
      the indeterminate forms are classified the same way for any type of limit.

      The first application of derivatives is a strange reversal:
      after using limits to define derivatives,
      we are going to use derivatives to calculate limits.
      L'H&#xf4;pital's rule is a method that applies to limits of type
      <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m> or type <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>.
      In this case,
      if <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are differentiable functions, L'H&#xf4;pital's rule states that the limit is preserved if we differentiate both numerator and denominator.
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f^\prime(x)}{g^\prime(x)}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is particular useful in asymptotic analysis, where many limits
      (as <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m>)
      have type <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the claim that <m>\ln x</m> is asymptotically slower than <m>\sqrt{x}</m>.
          We use L'H&#xf4;pital's rule to prove the claim.
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\ln x}{\sqrt{x}} = \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\frac{1}{x}}{\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}} = \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{2 \sqrt{x}}{x} = \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{2}{\sqrt{x}} = 0
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          A limit of <m>0</m> means that the numerator has lower asymptotic order than the denominator;
          we were justified in saying that the logarithm <m>\ln x</m> is asymptotically slower that <m>\sqrt{x}</m>.

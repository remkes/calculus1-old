  <title>Other Resources</title>
  <p>
    In addition to the notes associated to each lecture,
    there are a number of other resources which are distributed via the course website.
    These resources have been developed to assist you,
    so please make use of them.

          A set of pre-calculus notes.
          This is a document which I have prepared to answer the question:
          what should I know from high-school mathematics in order to succeed at calculus?
          If you are unsure about your background,
          please read these notes and use them to identify potential difficulties with high-school level mathematics.

          A complete formula sheet.
          All of the basic formulas and rules for calculation are included on this sheet.
          There are sections on algebra,
          trigonometry, derivatives and integrals.

          A library of functions.
          This reference gives archetypical examples of all of the elementary functions that we use in calculus.
          There are also small example graphs,
          so that you can develop a visual intuition for common functions.

          A notation reference.
          Though many of the idea in the course have been covered in high-school mathematics,
          often our notations differ.
          This reference covers a number of notations used in the course which may be unfamiliar.

          A course outcomes sheet.
          This was originally developed as a study aid for students.
          It summarizes the main definitions and concepts of the course,
          as well as the types of questions your will encounter on assignments and exams.
          In particular, it gives a guide to the material on the exam.
          If you want to know whether a definition,
          topic or type of problem might show up on the exam, consult this sheet.
          There will be nothing on the exam that isn't referenced on this sheet.

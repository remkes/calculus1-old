  <title>Linear Approximation</title>
  <p>
    In this last section on differentiation,
    we discuss a third interpretation of the derivative.
    So far, we have viewed the derivative as the rate of change or the slope of a tangent line.
    The third interpretation is as a linear approximation to the function.

    In <xref ref="figure-linear-approximation">Figure</xref>,
    we've drawn the function <m>f(x) = 3^x</m> and the tangent line at the point <m>(1,3)</m>.
    The derivative is <m>f^\prime(x) = 3^x \ln 3</m>,
    so the slope at <m>(1,3)</m> is <m>3 \ln 3</m>,
    which is approximatly <m>3.296</m>.
    The equation of the tangent line is <m>y = (3 \ln 3) x + (3 - 3 \ln 3)</m>.

  <p>
    In <xref ref="figure-tangent-zoom">Figure</xref>
    we zoom in very close on <m>(1,3)</m>.
    In this zoom,
    the graph of the function and the graph of the tangent line are very close.
    That means that value of the function is very close to the value of the linear function described by the tangent line.
    Therefore, we can use the tangent line as a linear approximation of the function.
    <me>
      3^x \cong (3 \ln 3) x + (3 - 3 \ln 3) = 3 + (3 \ln 3) (x- 1)
    </me>
  </p>

    In more generality,
    if <m>f(x)</m> is differentiable at <m>(a, f(a))</m>,
    then near that point we can use the derivative to produce a good linear approximation.
    <me>
      f(x) \cong f(a) + f^\prime(a) (x-a)
    </me>
  </p>

    Obviously, a linear approximation is only useful near the chosen point.
    However, that use is still significant.
    Consider the functions <m>\sin x</m> and <m>\cos x</m>.
    At <m>a=0</m>, we have these linear approximations:
    <md>
      <mrow>\sin x \amp  \cong \sin (0) + \cos (0) x = x</mrow>
      <mrow>\cos x \amp  \cong \cos (0) + \sin (0) x = 1</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    In trigonometry, we use these identities frequently.
    For small angles, we often replace
    <m>\sin x \cong x</m> and <m>\cos x \cong 1</m>.

    <p>
      The calculation of infinite limits is similar to the same steps as finite limits except that the first step,
      evaluation, is impossible.
      We start at the second step and look for a simple logical explanation.
      If such an explanation is not forthcoming,
      the limit is an indeterminate form and we use algegra and the limit rules.
      The limit rules apply to infinite limits as they did to finite limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the algebraic methods already discussed,
      for infinite limits there is a powerful technique called asymptotic analysis.
      In practice,
      this is the most commonly used approach to infinite limits.
    </p>

      Asymptotic analysis interprets limit at infinity as a measurement of the growth of functions.
      The functions <m>f_1(x) = x</m>,
      <m>f_2(x) = x^2</m> and <m>f_3(x) = e^x</m> all get very large as <m>x</m> gets very large;
      they all grow.
      Asymptotic analysis asks which of these functions grows faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The limit of a ratio of function
      <m>\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m> is asking essentially the same question.
      By looking at the ratio of two functions as <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m>,
      we ar implicitly asking which grows faster.
      If <m>g</m> grows faster,
      then the denominator should outpace the numerator,
      and the limit should tend to <m>0</m>.
      If <m>f</m> grows faster,
      then the numerator should outpace the denominator and the limit should tend to <m>\infty</m>.
      If <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> has roughly the same growth,
      then the limit should settle to some finite value larger than <m>0</m>.
      This leads to the notion of asymptotic order.

    <title>Asymptotic Order</title>
    <p>
      In asymptotic analysis, we start with a quotient limit.
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow \pm \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}
      </me>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If this limit is <m>0</m>,
            then we say that <m>g</m> has greater asymptotic order than <m>f</m>.
            Alternatively,
            we say that <m>g</m> grows faster than or <m>g</m> dominates <m>f</m> as <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If this limit is <m>\infty</m>,
            then we say that <m>f</m> has greater asymptotic order than <m>g</m>.
            Alternatively,
            we say that <m>f</m> grows faster than or <m>f</m> dominates <m>g</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If this limit is finite but non-zero,
            we say that <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> have the same asymptotic order.
            Alternatively,
            we say that <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> grow at the same asymptotic rate and neither dominates.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      With this definition,
      we can evaluate many limits by just knowing which functions have greater or lesser asymptotic order.

      Here are several rules for asymptotic order of functions.
      Many of these are obvious, but some require more work to establish.
      The proofs of these statements are not included in this course.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            A constant function <m>f(x) = c</m> has a lower asymptotic order than any increasing function.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Any multiple of a function <m>c f(x)</m> has the same asymptotic order as the original function <m>f(x)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The logarithm <m>f(x) = \ln x</m> grows slower than any function <m>f(x) = x^r</m> for <m>r > 0</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The function <m>f(x) = x^r</m> grows slower than
            <m>g(x) = x^s</m> as long as <m>0 \lt r\lt s</m>.
            In particular,
            polynomials of lower degree grow slower than polynomials of higher degree.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The exponential function <m>f(x) = e^x</m> grows faster than <m>g(x) = x^r</m> for any <m>r</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The function <m>f(x) = x^x</m> grows faster than <m>g(x) = e^x</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      These are the most common types of functions we will consider.
      We can summarize this in a list of asymptotic orders:
      in the following list <sq><m>f\lt g</m></sq> means that <m>f</m> grows slower than <m>g</m>.
      <me>
        c \lt  \ln x \lt  \ldots \lt  x^{\frac{1}{3}} \lt  x^{\frac{1}{2}} \lt  x \lt  x^2 \lt  x^3 \lt  \ldots \lt  e^x \lt  x^x \lt  \ldots
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the basic list and is something you will either memorize or frequently reference for many limits in this course.
      There are other functions at the top of this list which grow faster than <m>x^x</m>,
      but they are not frequently used.

  <title>Perspectives and Philosophy</title>
  <p>
    In addition to the strictly mathematical material of the course, I will try to share some ideas about the philosophy of mathematics,
    its aesthetics,
    and how our own worldview and assumptions influence mathematical thought.
    There will be short introductions to each lecture using aquotation and a particular question about the nature,
    existence and role of mathematics.
    I hope that you engage with these questions and find them intriguing.
    The perspectives and philosophy aspect of the course will not be part of the exam.

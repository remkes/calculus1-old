    Let <m>f: [a,b] \rightarrow \RR</m> be a function.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A point <m>(c,f(c))</m> is called a <em>local maximum</em>
          for <m>f</m> if <m>f(c) \lt f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> close
          to <m>c</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A point is a <em>local minimum</em> if <m>f(c) \lt f(x)</m>
          for all <m>x</m> close to <m>c</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The plurals of these terms are local minima and local maxima; if
    we want to refer to both, we will simply say local extrema. We
    can also define global extrema.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The point <m>(c,f(c))</m> is a global maximum if
          <m>f(c) > f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> in the domain of the function.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The point is a global minimum if
          <m>f(c) \lt f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> in the domain.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    One of the most important uses of derivatives is finding local
    extrema. The reason that derivatives are useful is that local
    extrema (for differentiable functions) are identified by their
    tangent lines. Look at the tangent lines <xref
    ref="figure-tangent-lines-at-extrema">Figure</xref>.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="figure-tangent-lines-at-extrema">
    <caption>Tangent Lines at Extrema</caption>
    <image width="85%" source="images/figure54"/>
  </figure>
  <p>
    The tangent lines are horizontal at maximum or minimum values. We
    can make use of this fact to try to find these extrema.
    Horizontal tangent lines have zero slope, to they can only occur
    when <m>f^\prime(x) = 0</m>. Therefore, we look for points
    <m>x</m> where the derivative vanishes. Such points will be
    called the <em>critical points</em> of the function.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the quadratic <m>f(x) = x^2 + 2</m>. The derivative
        is <m>f^\prime(x) = 2x</m>. To find the critical points, we
        set the derivative equal to zero.
        <md>
          <mrow>
            f(x) \amp  = x^2 + 2
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            f^\prime(x) \amp  = 2x
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            2x \amp  = 0 \implies x = 0
          </mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        So <m>x=0</m> is the only critical point. After we have found
        a critical point, we need to determine if it is a maximum,
        minimum, or neither. We do this by looking at the sign of the
        derivative near the critical point. The easiest way to record
        this information is in intevals of increase and decrease. We
        divide the <em>domain</em> of the function into pieces
        seperated by the critical points.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this example, the domain is <m>\RR</m> and the only
        critical point is <m>x=0</m>. Splitting the domain by that
        critical point gives us the intervals <m>(-\infty, 0)</m> and
        <m>(0,\infty)</m>. On these intervals, the derivative will
        either be positive or negative, so the function will either be
        increasing or decreasing respectively. For this example,
        <m>f^\prime(x) = 2x</m>, which is negative on
        <m>(-\infty,0)</m> and positive on <m>(0, \infty)</m>;
        therefore, the function is decreasing on <m>(-\infty,0)</m>
        and increasing on <m>(0, \infty)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This lets us classify the critical point. At <m>x=0</m>, the
        function switches from decreasing to increasing. This means
        that <m>x</m> must be a minimum. We can conclude that
        <m>(0,2)</m> is a local minimum of the function.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>f(x) = 2x^3 + 3x^2 - 36x + 4</m> then <m>f^\prime(x) =
        6x^2 + 6x - 36 = 6(x^2 + x - 6)</m>. We set the derivative
        equal to zero to find the critical points.

      <p>
        We have two critical points, <m>x=2</m> and <m>x=-3</m>. The
        domain of the function is <m>\RR</m>, so the intervals are
        <m>(-\infty,-3)</m>, <m>(-3,2)</m> and <m>(2,\infty)</m>. We
        check the sign of the derivative on these intevals; we do this
        by simply choosing any point in the interval and evaluated.
        The following table shows the intervals and the behaviour of
        the derivative on each interval.

      <p>
        Then at <m>x=-3</m>, the function switches from increasing to
        decreasing, so <m>(-3,85)</m> is a local maximum. At
        <m>x=2</m>, the function switches from decreasing to
        increasing, so <m>(2,-48)</m> is a local minimum. <xref

      Let <m>f: [a,b] \rightarrow \RR</m> be a function.
      <ul>
        <li>
          A point <m>(c,f(c))</m> is called a <em>local maximum</em>
          for <m>f</m> if <m>f(c) \geq f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> close
          to <m>c</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          A point is a <em>local minimum</em> if <m>f(c) \leq f(x)</m>
          for all <m>x</m> close to <m>c</m>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The plurals of these terms are local minima and local maxima; if
      I want to refer to both, I will simply say local extrema. I
      can also define global extrema.
      <ul>
        <li>
          The point <m>(c,f(c))</m> is a global maximum if
          <m>f(c) > f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> in the domain of the
          function.
        </li>
        <li>
          The point is a global minimum if
          <m>f(c) \lt f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> in the domain.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most important uses of derivatives is finding local
      extrema. The reason that derivatives are useful is that local
      extrema (for differentiable functions) are identified by their
      tangent lines. Look at the tangent lines <xref
      ref="figure-tangent-lines-at-extrema" />.
    </p>

          import graph;

          xaxis("$x$");
          yaxis("$y$");
          
          draw((0,3){SE}..{E}(2,1.6){E}..{E}(4,4){E}..{SE}(6,3));

          label("$f(x)$",(0.8,2.2),NE);

          draw((0,1.6)--(4,1.6));

    <p>
      The tangent lines are horizontal at maximum or minimum values. 
      I can make use of this fact to try to find these extrema.
      Horizontal tangent lines have zero slope, to they can only occur
      when <m>f^\prime(x) = 0</m>. Therefore, I look for points
      <m>x</m> where the derivative vanishes. Such points will be
      called the <em>critical points</em> of the function.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I solve <m>f^\prime(x) = 0</m> to find the critical
      points, I don't know if these critical points are minima, maxima
      or neither. However, I can look at the intervals between the
      critical points. I usually do this in a table of interval,
      demonstrated in <xref ref="example-extrema1" /> and <xref
      ref="example-extrema2" />. I use the
      critical points to split up the domain into intervals. It is
      important that I split <em>the domain</em> into intervals: if
      the domain already has breaks in it, these are further split
      up by the critical points.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once I have these intervals, I will test the derivative on each
      interval. Between the critical points (and any division of the
      domain), the derivative will either be entirely positive or
      entirely negative. Therefore, I can test any point I wish in the
      interval. If I find that the derivative is positive, I know the
      function is increasing. If I find the derivative is negative,
      then the function is decreasing. Determining this information is
      called <term>finding the intervals of increase and
      decrease</term> for the function, which is itself very useful
      information for understanding the behaviour of the function.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intervals tell me about the function at it critical points.
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the interval on the left of a critical is increasing and
          the interval on the right of a critical point is decreasing,
          then the critical point is a maximum. (The function changes
          from going up to the critical point to going down after it.) 
        </li>
        <li>
          If the interval on the left of a critical is decreasing and
          the interval on the right of a critical point is increasing,
          then the critical point is a minimum. (The function changes
          from going downto the critical point to going up after it.) 
        </li>
        <li>
          If the function is increasing on both sides of the critical
          point, or similar if it is decreasing on both sides of the
          critical point, the critical is neither a minimum nor a
          maxiumu. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      A example of the last situation is the point <m>(0,0)</m> on the
      graph of the cubic <m>f(x) = x^3</m>. There is a critical points
      there and the tangent line is momentarily flat, but the function
      is increasing on both sides and there isn't a minimum or a
      maximum.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of this gives us a nice algorithm for calculating extrema of
      functions, as well as finding their intervals of increase and
      decrease. Let me recap the algorithm for a differentiable
      function <m>f(x)</m>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          I calculate the derivative <m>f^\prime(x)</m>
        </li>
        <li>
          I set the derivative equal to zero and solve for the
          critical points.
        </li>
        <li>
          I use the critical point to break up the domain into
          intervals.
        </li>
        <li>
          I test the derivative on each interval (using any point I
          want in the interval) to determine if it is positive or
          negative. Where is it positive, I label the interval as
          increasing; where is it negative, I label the interval as
          decreasing.
        </li>
        <li>
          I use the intervals to determine which critical points are
          maxima, which are minima, and which are neither. 
        </li>
      </ul>

          Consider the quadratic <m>f(x) = x^2 + 2</m>. The derivative
          is <m>f^\prime(x) = 2x</m>. To find the critical points, I
          set the derivative equal to zero.

        <p>
          So <m>x=0</m> is the only critical point. After I have found
          a critical point, I need to determine if it is a maximum,
          minimum, or neither. I do this by looking at the sign of the
          derivative near the critical point. The easiest way to record
          this information is in intevals of increase and decrease. I
          divide the <em>domain</em> of the function into pieces
          separated by the critical points.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this example, the domain is <m>\RR</m> and the only
          critical point is <m>x=0</m>. Splitting the domain by that
          critical point gives the intervals <m>(-\infty, 0)</m> and
          <m>(0,\infty)</m>. I set up a table to test the intervals.

          This table lets me classify the critical point. At
          <m>x=0</m>, the function switches from decreasing to
          increasing. This means that <m>x</m> must be a minimum. I
          can conclude that <m>(0,2)</m> is a local minimum of the
          function.

          Now I'll consider a cubic <m>f(x) = 2x^3 + 3x^2 - 36x +

          I have two critical points, <m>x=2</m> and <m>x=-3</m>. The
          domain of the function is <m>\RR</m>, so the intervals are
          <m>(-\infty,-3)</m>, <m>(-3,2)</m> and <m>(2,\infty)</m>. I
          check the sign of the derivative on these intevals; I do this
          by simply choosing any point in the interval and evaluated.
          The following table shows the intervals and the behaviour of
          the derivative on each interval.

          Then at <m>x=-3</m>, the function switches from increasing to

    <title>Solving By Direct Integration</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="section-differential-equations" />, I talked about
      differential equations in order to understand derivatives as
      rates of changes. I looked at autonomous differential equations,
      particularly for populations models, and I used the qualitative
      technique of phase-line analysis to understand them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that I know how to calculate derivatives and integrals in some
      detail, I can return to differential equations. With these
      techniques, I'll actually try to solve the DEs, instead of
      using a qualitative approach. In the easiest case, the right
      side of a DE only involves the independent variable. (This is
      the opposite of the autonomous equation, where the right side
      only involved the <em>dependent</em> variable.)
      <me>
        \frac{df}{dx} = g(x)
      </me>
      Since only the independant variable <m>x</m> appears on the
      right side, I can simply integrate both sides in <m>x</m>. 
      <me>
        \int \frac{df}{dx} dx = \int g(x) dx
      </me>
      On the left, the integral of the derivative is the original
      funciton <m>f</m>.
      <me>
        f(x) = \int g(x) dx
      </me>
      In this case, solving the differential equation is just doing an
      integral. In some sense, solving most differential equations
      involves undoing the derivative, involves some kind of
      integral. However, it usually isn't this straightforward.
      Usually, it is difficult (if not impossible) to find the right
      way to undo the derivative.

    <title>Initial Value Problems</title>
    <p>
      When I integrate to solve a DE, I will get a constant of
      integration. In order to determine that constant, I am often
      given an initial condition, such as <m>f(0) = 0</m>.
      Differential equations problems with initial conditions are
      often called <em>initial value problems</em> (IVPs).

      <statement>
        <p>
          Here is a differential equation with an initial condition
          provided. After integrating both sides to solve the
          differential equation, I replace <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> with
          the values from the initial condition to solve for the
          constant of integrate. This lets me state a unique solution
          at the end.

    <title>Separable Differential Equations</title>
    <p>
      Solving DEs is a very difficult task in general; the previous
      examples were all artificially simple. For this course, I'm 
      going to restrict to a specific type of DE called a separable
      equation. Let <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(y)</m> be continuous
      functions in <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, respectively. Separable
      differential equations are DEs where the dependent and
      independent variable can be separated by a product.
      <me>
        \frac{dy}{dx} = f(x) g(y)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, this includes the autonomous equations 
      previously studied; if I set <m>f=1</m> in the previous
      expression, the resulting DE is an autonomous equation.
    </p>
    <p>
      To solve these equations, I divide by  <m>g(y)</m> to move that
      function to the the left side of the equation. Then I integrate
      in <m>x</m>. 
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \frac{1}{g(y)} \frac{dy}{dx} \amp = f(x)
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \int \frac{1}{g(y)} \frac{dy}{dx} dx \amp = f(x) dx
        </mrow>
      </md>
      With a substitution <m>y = y(x)</m> (so that <m>dy =
      \frac{dy}{dx} dx</m>), I can change the left side
      of the integral into an integral in <m>y</m>. (This looks
      strange, but it's really deciding to treat <m>y</m> as a
      variable, instead of as a function <m>y(x)</m>). 
      <me>
        \int \frac{1}{g(y)} dy = \int f(x) dx + c 
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      I have now separated the problem into two integrals, hence
      calling this a separable equation. Now I try to integrate both
      sides. In the integral, I need a constant of integration (which
      I wrote as <m>c</m>) but it is sufficient to include it on just
      one side of the equation.  After the integration is complete, I
      try to solve for <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m>. If I can,
      that function is the solution. Often I can't, and I leave the
      result as an implicit expression in <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.

          Here is a separable initial value problem. First, I want to
          move all the <m>y</m> variables to the left. I can do that
          by simply multiplying by <m>y</m>.

          Using the substitution, I write the integral on the left as

          to solve for <m>y</m>.

          After the integral and solving for <m>y</m>, I replace
          <m>y</m> and <m>x</m> with the values from the initial
          condition to solve for <m>c</m>. Determining the value of
          the constant, I could write the final solution to the
          initial value problem.

          Here is another separable initial value problem. I proceed

          Then I integrate both sides and try to solve for <m>y</m>.
          In this case, I could isolate <m>y</m>, but to do so would
          involve a square root and I would have to choose the
          positive or negative square root. To leave the solution
          without having to make that choice, I can leave the
          expression in <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> as it is, without
          isolating one variable. In that form, I can still input the
          initial value and solve for the constant of integration.

          This is the final, implicit form. I can notice that this is
          an equation of a circle, so the graph of the function must
          look like part of a circle. (If can't be the whole circle,
          of course, since that doesn't satisfy a vertical line test.)
          If I want it expressed as a function, I can still solve for
          <m>y</m> after this.

          Then I do both integrals and solve for <m>y</m>. After

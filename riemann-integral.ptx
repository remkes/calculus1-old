    <title>Definition</title>
    <p>
      Recall the distance travelled problem described in <xref
      ref="subsection-distance-problem" />, where I tried to
      understand the distance travelled by an object when I knew its
      velocity function <m>v(t)</m>. Geometrically, this was
      equivalent to finding the area under the graph of the function.
    </p>
    <p>
      I set up a process to solve this problem, at least
      approximately.  That process involved making rectangles under
      the curve and adding up the area of the rectangles, as in
      <xref ref="figure-improved-approximation-by-rectangles" />. 
      Integration will be the limit of this approximation process,
      just as differentiation was the limit of the approximation
      process of secant lines approaching the tangent line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sigma notation is a concice notation for the approximation
      of areas by rectangles. I am trying to calculate
      the area under the curve of <m>f(x)</m>, a positive function,
      defined on an interval <m>[a,b]</m>. I divide the area
      into <m>n</m> rectangles; if I divide equally, the width of
      each rectangle will be <m>\frac{b-a}{n}</m>. The height of the
      rectangle will be the function value <m>f(x^*)</m> where
      <m>x^*</m> is some particular <m>x</m> in the subinterval.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these notations, the area of a rectangle is width times
      height, that is <m>\frac{b-a}{n} f(x^*)</m>. To be more
      specific, if I use <m>k</m> as an index to refer to various
      rectangles and <m>x_k^*</m> is in the kth interval, the area of
      the <m>k</m>th rectangle is <m>\frac{b-a}{n} f(x_k^*)</m>. To
      get the complete approximation, I add up all these rectangles
      with sigma notation.
      <me>
        A \cong \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{b-a}{n} f(x_k^*)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This sum is called a <term>Riemann sum</term> approximation for
      area. If the function is well behaved (continuous guaranteees
      this), then I can keep taking finer and finer partitions for
      better and better approximations. This process can be extended
      into some kind of limit process. In the limit, I hope for a
      perfect calculation of area.
      <me>
        A = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^n f(x_k^*)
        \frac{b-a}{n}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This limit, if it exists, is called a <term>definite
      integal</term>.  The area under the curve is calculated by a
      definite integral.  Since this definition uses Riemann sums,
      this is called the Riemann definiton of the integral, or simply
      the Riemann integral. It has a new notation.
      <me>
        \int_a^b f(x) dx := \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^n
        f(x_k^*) \frac{b-a}{n}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      I should explain the notation. The sigma of sigma notation gets
      replaced with <m>\int</m>, which is the integral sign. The
      bounds <m>k=1</m> and <m>n</m> get replaced with the endpoints
      of the interval, <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> respectively. The
      <m>f(x^*_k)</m> just becomes the function <m>f(x)</m>. Finally,
      the width <m>\frac{b-a}{n}</m> gets infinitesimally small as <m>n
      \rightarrow \infty</m>, so it becomes the infinitesimal term
      <m>dx</m>. Like Leibniz notation, this <m>dx</m> is a relic
      from a different historical presentation of calculus. Its main
      purpose in the modern notation is to indicate what symbol is the
      variable. However, as will be seen in <xref
      ref="section-substitution-rule" />, this <m>dx</m> notation is
      useful for a variety of integration calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first problem with limit definition is the existence of the
      limit. Unfortunately, this is an extremely difficult question
      to solve in general, particularly since it has to work for any
      possible choices of the values <m>x_k^*</m>. Fortunately, this
      limit will always exist if <m>f(x)</m> is continuous, a fact
      that is presented here without proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      I should point out some important observations. First, this
      integral returns a number: given a function and endpoints, it
      calculates a fixed area. It isn't (yet) a new function. Second,
      I need the bounds: the Riemann integral doesn't make any sense
      without the bounds of the interval <m>[a,b]</m>. Third, I
      defined this for positive functions. It also works for functions
      which have negative values, but areas below the <m>x</m> axis
      are interpreted as negative. If a function has both positive and
      negative values, the integral will give the difference between
      the area above the axis (the positive area) and the area below
      the (the negative area).
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall when I talked about the derivatives, I mentioned that
      the definition was correct and rigorous but difficult to use.
      That comment is also true here, but even more severe. The
      definition of the integral is nearly impossible to use for most
      functions. I will only try to use the definition for small
      order polynomials.

          I start with the setup of the Riemann integral. I need to
          make a choice for <m>x_k^*</m>. I'll take the standard
          choice of <m>x_k^* = a + k \frac{b-a}{n}</m>, which in this

          Then I apply the square to each piece of the term in

          I simplify the expression by expanding the multiplication.
          Then I can evaluate this as an asymptotic analysis limit.
          The asymptotic orders are the same, so the limit is the
          ratio of the leading terms. This will complete the integral.

        The <m>\frac{b-a}{n}</m> terms becomes <m>\frac{3}{n}</m>.
        This term doesn't involve <m>k</m>, so it can be factored

        I simplify the expression by expanding the multiplication in
        each numerator.  Then I can evaluate this as an asymptotic
        analysis limit.  The asymptotic orders are the same in each
        term (and I can treat each term independently, since the
        limits splits up over addition), so the limit is the ratio
        of the leading terms in each piece of the sum. Adding the
        various pieces together completes the integral.

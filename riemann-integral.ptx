    <title>Definition</title>
    <p>
      Recall the distance travelled problem, where we tried to
      understand the distance travelled by an object when we knew its
      velocity function <m>v(t)</m>. Geometrically, this was
      equivalent to finding the area under the graph of the function.
    </p>
    <p>
      We set up a process to solve this problem, at least
      approximately. That process involved making rectangles under
      the curve and adding up the area of the rectangles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Integration will be the limit of this approximation process,
      just as differentiation was the limit of the approximation
      process of secant lines approaching the tangent line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sigma notation gives us a concice notation for the approximation
      of areas by rectangles. Let's say we are trying to calculate
      the area under the curve of <m>f(x)</m>, a positive function,
      defined on an interval <m>[a,b]</m>. We are dividing the area
      into <m>n</m> rectangles; if we divide equally, the width of
      each rectangle will be <m>\frac{b-a}{n}</m>. The height of the
      rectangle will be the function value <m>f(x^*)</m> where
      <m>x^*</m> is some particular <m>x</m> in the subinterval.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these notations, the area of a rectangle is width times
      height, that is <m>\frac{b-a}{n} f(x^*)</m>. To be more
      specific, is we use <m>k</m> as an index to refer to various
      rectganles and <m>x_k^*</m> is in the kth interval, the are of
      the kth rectangle is <m>\frac{b-a}{n} f(x_k^*)</m>. To get the
      complete approximation, we add up all these rectangles with
      sigma notation.
      <me>
        A \cong \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{b-a}{n} f(x_k^*)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This sum is called a Riemann Sum approximation for area. If the
      function is well behaved (for us, continuous), then we can keep
      taking finer and finer partitions for better and better
      approximations. This process can be extended into some kind of
      limit process. In the limit, we expect a perfect calculation of
      area.
      <me>
        A = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^n f(x_k^*)
        \frac{b-a}{n}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This limit, if it exists, is called a <em>definite integal</em>.
      The area under the curve is calculated by a definite integral.
      Since this definition uses Riemann sums, we call this the
      Riemann definiton of the integral, or simply the Riemann
      integral. It has a new notation.
      <me>
        \int_a^b f(x) dx := \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^n
        f(x_k^*) \frac{b-a}{n}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We can explain the notation. The sigma of sigma notation gets
      replaced with <m>\int</m>, which is the integral sign. The
      bounds <m>k=1</m> and <m>n</m> get replaced with the endpoint of
      the interval, <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> respectively. The
      <m>f(x^*_k)</m> just becomes the function <m>f(x)</m>. Finally,
      the term <m>\frac{b-a}{n}</m> gets infinitesimally small as <m>n
      \rightarrow \infty</m>, so it becomes the infinitesimal term
      <m>dx</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first problem with limit definition is the existence of the
      limit. Unfortunately, this is an extremely difficult question
      to solve in general, particular since it has to work for any
      possible choices of the values <m>x_k^*</m>. Fortunately, this
      limit will always exist if <m>f(x)</m> is continuous, a fact
      that is presented here without proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should point out some important facts. First, this integral
      returns a number: given a function and endpoints, it calculates
      a fixed area. It isn't (yet) a new function. Second, we need
      the bounds: the Riemann integral doesn't make any sense without
      the bounds of the interval <m>[a,b]</m>. Third, we defined this
      for positive functions. It also works for functions which have
      negative values, but areas below the <m>x</m> axis are
      interpreted as negative. If a function has both positive and
      negative values, the integral will give the difference between
      the area above the axis (the positive area) and the area below
      the (the negative area).
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall when we talked about the derivatives, we mentioned that
      the definition was correct and rigorous but difficult to use.
      That comment is also true here, but even more severe. The
      definition of the integral is nearly impossible to use for most
      functions. We will only try to use the definition for small
      order polynomials.

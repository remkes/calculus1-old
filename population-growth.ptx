    <title>A Motivating Problem</title>
    <p>
      A very natural motivating problem is population growth. Here are
      some reasonable mathematical questions one might ask about
      population.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            How do we encode population growth as a function?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            What factors affect the growth of population?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            What is the long-term behaviour of a population?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            What is the growth rate of a population?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      To encode population growth as a function, we chose a function
      <m>p(t)</m> representing population (<m>p</m>) in terms of the
      independant variable time (<m>t</m>). Often we start with a data
      set, representing the values of a certain population over a
      period of time. <xref ref="table-population-data" /> gives some
      example population data.

      I can try to match this data with a function, as I did with
      other functions in <xref ref="subsection-regression" />. The
      growth of this population is best matched by an exponential
      function, show in <xref ref="figure-exponential-regression" />.

      So how did I come up with this exponential function? One way to
      do this regression is to look at doubling periods. By
      observation, the data looks like it doubles roughly every four
      years. (This isn't perfect, since over some five year patterns
      is more than doubles and over other it fall short, but this
      isn't a bad guess). For doubling, I can think of powers of
      <m>2</m>, so an exponential function base <m>2</m>. If I double
      every <m>d</m> unites of time, the appropriate exponential
      function is
      <me>
        p(t) = a 2^{\frac{1}{d} t} 
      </me>
      where <m>a</m> is the starting value of the poluation. In this
      case, I used the function 
      <me>
        p(t) = (1032) 2^{\frac{t}{4}}
      </me>
      to do the regression, and it fits reasonably well. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It is conventional to use the base <m>e</m> in calculus. I can
      change my previous exponential function using the fact that <m>2
      = e^{\ln 2}</m>. 
      <me>
        p(t) = a \left( (e^{\ln 2} \right)^{\frac{1}{d} t} 
      </me>
      Successive exponents are simplified by multiplying the
      exponents.
      <me>
        p(t) = a e^{\ln 2\frac{1}{d} t} = ae^{\frac{t \ln 2}{d}}
      </me>
      This is a nice general way to write an exponential function with
      starting value <m>a</m> and doubling period <m>d</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the data, I included the percentage growth for each year.
      Though there is a lot of variability, there is also some
      consistency here. The percentage growth varies above and below
      20%, but remains somewhat nearby that value. So, why does
      relatively consistent percentage growth require an exponential
      regression? What's the connection between percentage growth and
      exponential functions? I'd like to take this as a motivating
      question for the course. Calculus can understand and describe
      growth-rates, like percentage growth, and relate them to
      functions. In the next section, we'll start to sketch out the
      approach to this motivating question.

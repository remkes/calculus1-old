  <title>Population Growth</title>
  <p>
    A very natural motivating problem is population growth. Here are
    some reasonable mathematical questions we might ask about
    population.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          How do we encode population growth as a function?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          What factors affect the growth of population?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          What is the long-term behaviour of a population?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          What is the growth rate of a population?
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    To encode population growth as a function, we chose a function
    <m>p(t)</m> representing population (<m>p</m>) in terms of the
    independant variable time (<m>t</m>).

    Consider this data set for a population (where <m>t</m> is counted
    in years). This growth looks exponential. We could apply
    exponential regression to find an exponential function, as in
    <xref ref="figure-exponential-regression">Figure</xref>. However,
    there is another way of finding a function to fit this model,
    using the growth rates to find a function to fit the data.
    Algebraic techniques have a hard time understanding growth rates,
    or rates of change in general. In calculus, we will develop a
    tool called the <em>derivative</em> of a function which will
    measure its rate of change. For now, we are going to avoid the
    technical definition but work with the idea. We need some
    notation. For a function <m>p(t)</m>, there are two common ways
    of writing the derivative.
    <me>
      p^\prime(t) \hspace{1cm} \frac{dp}{dt}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    The first notation is called Newton's notation, and the second is
    called Leibniz's notation. We will use both in this course but we
    will rely on Leibniz's notation most of the time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The derivative is the rate of change of the function, so for this
    model, <m>\frac{dp}{dt}</m> is the growth rate of the population.
    The average annual increase in the data above is <m>20</m>%
    growth. That means that the growth rate (the amount of population
    added in a year) is <m>\frac{20}{100}</m> (or <m>\frac{1}{5}</m>)
    times the current population. We can express this as an
    equation.
    <me>
      \frac{dp}{dt} = \frac{1}{5} p(t)
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a mathematical translation of the understanding of
    percentage growth. An equation of this form, involving a function
    and its derivative, is called a <em>differential equation</em>
    (DE, in short). Very often in applied mathematics, it is easier
    to observe the rate of change of a function than the function
    itself. This leads to models expressed as differential equations.
    Many of the most important mathematical models in history are
    expressed as differential equations.
  </p>
  <p>
    The regression provided the function <m>p(t) =
    2^{\frac{t}{4}}</m>. We will see later in the course that the
    solution to this differential equation is a very similar
    function.
    <me>
      p(t) = e^{\frac{1}{5} t}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Solving differential equations is one of the major goals of
    calculus. The solution to this equation leads to the profound
    connection between percentage growth rate and exponential growth:
    if we observe a percentage growth rate, then the quantities we are
    observe should be described by an exponential function. This is
    how we know that many populations grow exponentially, as do
    functions involving resource use, radioactive decay, heat
    dissipation, debt repayment and investment interest. The
    importance of the exponential function is strongly related to its
    use as the solution to problems of percentage growth.
  </p>
  <p>
    DEs gives us a different approach to fiting a function to data.
    Instead of just using intuition to choose a class of functions and
    regression to get the specific function, we can look at the growth
    rates of the function in the data. If we can make a consistent
    observation about the growth rates, such as the observation that
    they grow by a consistent percentage, we can write that
    observation as a differential equation. We can then (hopefully)
    solve the differential equation to find the appropriate function.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before we worry about solving DEs, we simply want to understand
    what they say. Our goals is essentially translation: a
    differential equation is a mathematical translation of a statement
    about the growth rate of a quantity. We want to be able to pass
    both ways between the equation and the associated statement. We
    have seen how percentage growth with percentage <m>c</m>%
    translates into an equation. o
    <me>
      \frac{dp}{dt} = \frac{c}{100} p
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    We can translate other statements as well. Percentage decay says
    that we loose a percentage <m>c</m>% of the quantity per unit
    time.
    <me>
      \frac{dp}{dt} = -\frac{c}{100} p
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Not all differential equations are percentage growth. Perhaps the
    rate of change is proportional to the square of the current
    value.
    <me>
      \frac{dp}{dt} = c(p(t))^2
    </me>

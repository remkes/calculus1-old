    <title>A Motivating Problem</title>
    <p>
      A very natural motivating problem is population growth. Here are
      some reasonable mathematical questions we might ask about
      population.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            How do we encode population growth as a function?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            What factors affect the growth of population?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            What is the long-term behaviour of a population?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            What is the growth rate of a population?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      To encode population growth as a function, we chose a function
      <m>p(t)</m> representing population (<m>p</m>) in terms of the
      independant variable time (<m>t</m>). Often we start with a data
      set, representing the values of a certain population over a
      period of time. <xref ref="table-population-data" /> gives some
      example population data.

      We can try to match this data with a function, as we did with
      other functions in <xref ref="subsection-regression" />. The
      growth of this population is best matched by an exponential
      function, show in <xref ref="figure-exponential-regression" />.

    <p>
      In the data, I included the percentage growth for each year.
      Though there is a lot of variability, there is also some
      consistency here. The percentage growth varies above and below
      20%, but remains somewhat nearby that value. So, why does
      relatively consistent percentage growth require an exponential
      regression? What's the connection between percentage growth and
      exponential functions? I'd like to take this as a motivating
      question for the course. Calculus can understand and describe
      growth-rates, like percentage growth, and relate them to
      functions. In the next section, we'll start to sketch out the
      approach to this motivating question.

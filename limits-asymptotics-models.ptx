  <title>Limits, Asymptotics and Models</title>
  <p>
    We can use our tools of limits and asymptotic analysis to analyze
    models. Limits at finite values tell us how models behave near
    their undefined points; in particular, whether they diverge to
    infinity or remain bounded. This leads to an understanding of the
    limitations of a model and how it behaves at its own extreme
    situations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Limits at infinity and asymptotic analysis tells us about the
    growth and long term behaviour of a model. We can compare
    population growth models asymptotically to get an idea of which is
    fundamentally a faster growth model. The analysis of algorithms
    in computing science is also done almost entirely with asymptotic
    analysis; the asymptotic order of an algorithm is a very good
    measure of how fast it can operate.
  </p>
  <p>
    The notion of <em>stability</em> is frequently the focus of our
    study of limits and models. The word <sq>stability</sq> has
    various technical definitions in pieces of applied mathematics,
    but it always relates to the limits of the model and the behaviour
    near those limits.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we consider popluation models, we have four categories of long
    term (asymptotic) behaviour.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The function can grow without bound, as in the exponential
          growth function <m>p(t) = p_0 e^{at}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The function can decay to zero, as in the exponential decay
          function <m>p(t) = p_0 e^{-at}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The function can approach a steady state, as in the logistic
          growth function
          <me>
            p(t) = \frac{p_0 K e^{at}}{K + p_0 (e^{at}-1)}
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The function can osscilate without ever reaching a steady
          state, possibly with chaotic behaviour. A non-chaotic
          osscilating function is this periodic version of logistic
          growth:
          <me>
            p(t) = \left(\frac{p_0 K e^{at}}{K + p_0 (e^{at}-1)}
            \right) \left( 1 + \frac{1}{5} \sin (bt) \right)
          </me>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Asymptotic analysis can also give information about the extreme
    values in a model. Consider the ideal gas law (where <m>P</m> is
    pressure, <m>V</m> is volume, <m>n</m> is the amount of gas,
    <m>T</m> is temperature and <m>R</m> is a constant. (We assume
    that <m>P</m> and <m>V</m> are the variables, and <m>n</m>,
    <m>R</m> and <m>T</m> are constant.)
    <me>
      PV = nRT
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    We can ask what happens to pressure at low volumes, expressed as a
    limit as <m>V \rightarrow 0</m>.
    <me>
      \lim_{V \rightarrow 0} P = \lim_{V \rightarrow 0} \frac{nRT}{V}
      = \infty
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    This tells us that low volumes result in high pressures. We could
    equivalently ask what happens at very high volumes.
    <me>
      \lim_{V \rightarrow \infty} P = \lim_{V \rightarrow \infty}
      \frac{nRT}{V} = 0
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Unsurprisingly, very large volume result in very low pressures.
  </p>
  <p>
    The behaviour at extreme values depends on the particulars of the
    models. A more complicated gas law is the Vander Waal's gaw law
    (where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are new positive constants).
    <me>
      \left( P + \frac{n^2 a}{V^2} \right) \left( V - nb \right) =
      nRT
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    What happens for these gasses at high pressures?  It's difficult
    to solve directly for volume, but we can analyze the equation in
    its current form. If the term involving pressure grows very
    large, the term only involving volume must grow to zero, so that
    the product remains the same. That happens when <m>V</m> is very
    close to the value <m>nb</m>.
    <me>
      \lim_{P \rightarrow \infty} V = nb
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, in this model, extreme pressures happen near the fixed,
    but non-zero, volume <m>V = nb</m>.

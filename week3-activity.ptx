          the doubling period and write a guess of the appropriate
          exponential function. Evaluate that exponential function

        It looks like this data doubles about every five years. The
        starting value is 1. From the notes, I can use the provided
        structure for this exponential function: if <m>a</m> is the
        starting value and <m>d</m> is the doubling period, the
        function should be <m>a2^{\frac{t}{d}}</m>. Using the values from
        this data, here is the exponential function.
        <me>
          p(t) = 2^{\frac{t}{5}}
        </me>
        If I wanted, I could change base to write this as an
        exponential function with base <m>e</m>. (This is useful to do
        in many cases, since the base <m>e</m> is the most common and
        most useful base for exponential functions in calculus.) 
        <me>
          p(t) =  e^{\frac{t \ln 2}{5}}
        </me>
        The following table shows the values of this function to
        compare with the data set.

        It looks like this data doubles is something a little less
        than two years. I will guess a doubling period of
        <m>\frac{9}{5}</m>. The starting value is 3.  From the notes,
        I can use the provided structure for this exponential
        function: if <m>a</m> is the starting value and <m>d</m> is
        the doubling period, the function should be
        <m>a2^{\frac{t}{d}}</m>. Using the values from this data, here
        is the exponential function.
        <me>
          p(t) = (3) 2^{\frac{5t}{9}}
        </me>
        If I wanted, I could change base to write this as an
        exponential function with base <m>e</m>. (This is useful to do
        in many cases, since the base <m>e</m> is the most common and

            This guess was perhaps a little weaker. The function I
            produced is similar to the data, but seems to outpace it
            but a bit. A slightly smaller doubling period might have

          To calculate the phase line, I need the zeros of the right
          side of the equation. This is a quadratic and it factors as
          <m>(p-6)(p-3)</m>. Therefore, there are steady states at
          <m>p=3</m> and <m>p=6</m>. I label these points on the phase
          line. To determine the trajectories, I check the value of
          the right side of the equation between the steady states.

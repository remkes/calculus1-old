    <title>Integrals as Functions</title>
    <p>
      As mentioned above, we need a way to avoid using the definition.
      With derivative, we just developed a series of rules for various
      types and combinations of functions. That doesn't work as easily
      or cleanly for integrals. However, there is a very powerful
      theorem that gives us an approach to solving integrals.
    </p>
    <p>
      To state the theorem, we need to consider a strange new function.
      For <m>g(t)</m> continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> and <m>x \in [a,b)</m>,
      define a new function <m>f</m>.
      <me>
        f(x) := \int_a^x g(t) dt
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's give some interpretation: <m>f(x)</m> is the area under the
      function <m>g(t)</m> along the <m>t</m> axis between a fixed point
      <m>t=a</m> and a varying endpoint <m>x</m>. Be careful to keep
      the variables straight!  The variable <m>t</m> is only inside the
      integral and the variable <m>x</m> is only outside. <m>x</m> is
      the endpoint of the interval and <m>t</m> is the variable that
      goes between <m>a</m> and <m>x</m> on the interval.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though very strange, this definition is a rich source of new and
      interesting functions in mathematics.

        Now that we have this function <m>f(x)</m>, we can look at its
        derivative. <xref ref="figure-area-function" /> gives
        a useful visualization. In the figure, we've labelled a point
        <m>x</m> and a small increase <m>x+h</m>.

        We use the limit definition of the derivative.
        <me>
          \frac{d}{dx} f(x) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h) -
          f(x)}{h}

      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>f</m> measures area, the difference <m>f(x+h) - f(x)</m>
        is just the area of the very thin rectangle in <xref
        ref="figure-area-function" />. When <m>h</m> is small,
        this area is roughly the height <m>g(x)</m> times the width
        <m>h</m>.
        <me>
          \frac{d}{dx} f(x) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{g(x) h}{h} = g(x)
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        All this work can be summarized in the following statement, which
        is called the <em>Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</em>.
        <me>
        \frac{d}{dx} f(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \int_a^x g(t) dt = g(x)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The important implication of the fundamental theorem is this:
      integral and derivatives are opposite operations. In the previous
      statement, we start with a function <m>g</m>, take and integral to
      get <m>f</m> and then take a derivative to get back to <m>g</m>.
      Derivatives and integrals are reverse processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several versions of the fundamental theorem, but they
      all capture this basic idea of reserve processes. The derivative
      can be inside the integral.
      <me>
        \int_a^b f^\prime(t) dt = f(b) - f(a)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This version of the fundamental theorem gives us a wonderful way
      to calculate definite integrals. Let <m>F</m> be any function
      such that <m>F^\prime(x) = f(x)</m>. Such a function <m>F</m> is
      called an <em>antiderivative</em> for <m>f</m>. We use
      antiderivatives to evaluated integrals.
      <me>
        \int_a^b f(t) dt = F(b) - F(a)
      </me>
    </p>

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-indefinite-integral">
    <p>
      To calculate antiderivatives, we need to do deriavitves backwards.
      Fortunately, this is much easier than using the definition of the
      integral; it will become our main strategy for integrals.
      Unfortunately, it is still reasonably difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's useful to have a notation for antiderivatives. Since
      integrals are, in some way, the inverse operation, it seems
      natural to use an integral symbol to indicate an antiderivative.
      We drop the bounds that we used for definition integrals.
      <me>
        \text{ Any antiderivative of f is written }  \int f(x) dx
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is called an indefinite integral. Note that the notation
      means <em>all</em> anti-derivatives, since there may be more than
      one.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          In these examples, I'm using what I know about derivatives to
          do the operation backwards. The sixth example is just the
          power rules done backwards. The proofs of all of these are
          easy: just differentiate the right side of the equation.
          Since they are anti-derivatives, the derivative of the right
          side should give the original function on the left (inside the
          integral sign). The <m>+C</m> is an arbitrary constant which
          we must add. It shows up because it would disappear in
          differentiation.

      We can use the fundamental theorem to calculate definite
      integrals as well. There is some special notation that is
      useful here: when we write <m>\left. F(x) \right|_a^b</m> we

      subtract.

    <title>Classifying Types of Limits</title>
    <p>
      It will be useful for this section to elaborate on the term
      <term>indeterminate form</term> introduced in <xref
      ref="section-limits-at-finite-values" />. Recall that a limit is
      called an indeterminate form  if it cannot be directly evaluated
      or deterined by a simple logical analysis. I can classify
      indeterminate forms by their type. For now, I will look at three
      types. The first two types are quotient limits.
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> approach <m>\pm \infty</m>, the
      limit is called an indeterminate form of type
      <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m>. If instead both <m>f(x)</m> and
      <m>g(x)</m> approach <m>0</m>, then it is an indeterminate form
      of type <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>. In both cases, I want to use
      algebra to factor out and cancel off the pieces of the quotients
      which tends to <m>\infty</m> or <m>0</m> to solve the limit. (I
      previously cautioned about using <m>\infty</m> in arithmetic or
      dividing by zero. Both of those cautions stand. The expression
      <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m> and <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> used for
      indeterminate forms are <em>labels</em>, not calculations.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The third type of indeterminate form is a difference limit.
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) - g(x)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      If both <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> approach <m>\pm \infty</m>,
      this limit is called an indeterminate form of type <m>\infty -
      \infty</m>. For this type, I want to use common denominator,
      conjugates or other algegraic tricks to reduce it to a limit of
      type <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m> or type <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all these definitions, I could replace <m>x \rightarrow
      a</m> with the one-sided limit or <m>x \rightarrow \pm
      \infty</m>; the indeterminate forms are classified the same way
      for any type of limit. 
    </p>

    <title>A Novel Technique</title>
    <p>
      The calculation of infinite limits is similar to the same steps
      as finite limits except that the first step, evaluation, is
      impossible. I start at the second step and look for a simple
      logical analysis. If such an analysis is not forthcoming,
      the limit is an indeterminate form and I need to use algebra and
      the limit rules. The limit rules apply to infinite limits as they
      did to finite limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the algebraic methods already discussed, for
      infinite limits there is a powerful technique called asymptotic
      analysis. In practice, this is the most commonly used approach
      to infinite limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Asymptotic analysis interprets limits at infinity as a
      measurements of the growth of functions. The functions <m>f_1(x)
      = x</m>, <m>f_2(x) = x^2</m> and <m>f_3(x) = e^x</m> all get
      very large as <m>x</m> gets very large; they all grow.
      Asymptotic analysis asks which of these functions grows faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The limit of a ratio of function <m>\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m> is
      asking essentially the same question. By looking at the ratio
      of two functions as <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m>, I am
      implicitly asking which grows faster. If <m>g</m> grows faster,
      then the denominator should outpace the numerator, and the limit
      should tend to <m>0</m>. If <m>f</m> grows faster, then the
      numerator should outpace the denominator and the limit should
      tend to <m>\infty</m>. If <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> have roughly the
      same growth, then the limit should settle to some finite value
      larger than <m>0</m>. This leads to the notion of asymptotic
      order.

    <title>Asymptotic Order</title>
    <p>
      In asymptotic analysis, I start with a quotient limit.
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}
      </me>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If this limit is <m>0</m>, then <m>g</m> has
            <term>greater asymptotic order</term> than <m>f</m>.
            Alternatively, I can say that <m>g</m> grows faster than
            <m>f</m>or <m>g</m> dominates <m>f</m> as <m>x \rightarrow
            \infty</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If this limit is <m>\infty</m>, then <m>f</m>
            has greater asymptotic order than <m>g</m>.
            Alternatively, I cqn say that <m>f</m> grows faster than
            <m>g</m>or <m>f</m> dominates <m>g</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If this limit is finite but non-zero, then <m>f</m>
            and <m>g</m> have the same asymptotic order.
            Alternatively, I can say that <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> grow at
            the same asymptotic rate and neither dominates. 
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      With this definition, wI can evaluate many limits by just
      knowing which functions have greater or lesser asymptotic
      order.

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-asymptotic-ranking">
    <title>An Asymptotic Ranking of Functions</title>
    <p>
      Since I need to know the relative asymptotic order of functions,
      I want to make a ranking. There are several principles that go
      into such a ranking. Many of these are obvious, but some require
      more work to establish. The proofs of these statements are not
      included in this course.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            A constant function <m>f(x) = c</m> has a lower asymptotic
            order than any increasing function. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Any multiple of a function <m>c f(x)</m> has the same
            asymptotic order as the original function <m>f(x)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The logarithm <m>f(x) = \ln x</m> grows slower than any
            function <m>f(x) = x^r</m> for <m>r > 0</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The function <m>f(x) = x^r</m> grows slower than <m>g(x) =
            x^s</m> as long as <m>0 \lt r\lt s</m>. In particular,
            polynomials of lower degree grow slower than polynomials
            of higher degree.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The exponential function <m>f(x) = e^x</m> grows faster
            than <m>g(x) = x^r</m> for any <m>r</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      This covers most of the common types of growing funtions. 
      I can summarize this in a list of asymptotic orders: in the
      following list <sq><m>f\lt g</m></sq> means that <m>f</m> grows
      slower than <m>g</m>.
      <me>
        c \lt  \ln x \lt  \ldots \lt  x^{\frac{1}{3}} \lt
        x^{\frac{1}{2}} \lt  x \lt  x^2 \lt  x^3 \lt  \ldots \lt  e^x
        \lt   \ldots
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      You will frequently need to reference this list for many limits
      in the course. There are other functions at the top of this list
      which grow faster than <m>e^x</m>, but they are not frequently
      used.

    <title>Asymptotic Ranking, Sums and Product</title>
    <p>
      In quotient limits, the numerator or denominator may be more 
      complicated than the simple functions in the asymptotic ranking.
      There are two useful rules to help us work with <m>f</m> and
      <m>g</m> which are combinations of pieces of various asymptotic
      order.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>f = f_1 + f_2 + f_3 + \ldots + f_n</m> then the
            asymptotic order of <m>f</m> is the maximum of the
            asymptotic order of the <m>f_i</m>.  This means that in a
            sum or difference, I only need to consider the fastest
            growing pieces. I can simply ignore all the rest.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I don't have as precise a rule for products. However, I
            can say that the product of two growing functions has a
            higher asymptotic order than either piece. For example, 
            <m>xe^x</m> has greater asymptotic order than either
            <m>e^x</m> or <m>x</m>.

      To evaluate a limit of the form
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} 
      </me>
      I look at the asymptotic order. If <m>f</m> has a greater
      asymptotic order, the limit is <m>\infty</m> or <m>-\infty</m>
      (depending on the sign of the fraction as <m>x</m> gets large).
      If <m>g</m> has a greater asymptotic, the limit is zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> have the same asymptotic order, the
      value of the limit is the ratio of the <term>leading
      coefficients</term>. The leading coefficients are the
      coefficients which sit in front of the term with the highest
      asymptotic order in the numerator or denominator.

        <p>
          The order of the numerator is <m>x^4</m>. The order of the
          denominator is <m>x^5</m>. The denominator has a higher
          asymptotic order, so the limit is zero.

          The asymptotic order the numerator is <m>x^4</m> and the

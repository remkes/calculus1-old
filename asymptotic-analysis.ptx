    <title>Classifying Types of Limits</title>
    <p>
      It will be useful for this section to clarify the language we
      introduced in <xref ref="section-limits-at-finite-values" />
      concerning <em>indeterminate forms</em>. A limit is called an
      indeterminate form  if
      it cannot be evaluated or logically determined. We can classify
      indeterminate forms by their type. For now, we look at three
      types. The first two types involve quotient limits.
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> approach <m>\pm \infty</m>, the
      limit is called an indeterminate form of type
      <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m>. If instead both <m>f(x)</m> and
      <m>g(x)</m> approach <m>0</m>, then it is an indeterminate form
      of type <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>. In both cases, we want to use
      algebra to factor out and cancel off the pieces of the quotients
      which tends to <m>\infty</m> or <m>0</m> to solve the limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third type involves a difference limit.
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) - g(x)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      If both <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> approach <m>\pm \infty</m>,
      this limit is called an indeterminate form of type <m>\infty -
      \infty</m>. For this type, we want to use common denominator,
      conjugates or other algegraic tricks to reduce it to a limit of
      type <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m> or type <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all these definitions, we could replace <m>x \rightarrow
      a</m> with the one-sided limit or <m>x \rightarrow \pm
      \infty</m>; the indeterminate forms are classified the same way
      for any type of limit.

    <title>A Novel Technique</title>
    <p>
      The calculation of infinite limits is similar to the same steps
      as finite limits except that the first step, evaluation, is
      impossible. We start at the second step and look for a simple
      logical explanation. If such an explanation is not forthcoming,
      the limit is an indeterminate form and we use algebra and the
      limit rules. The limit rules apply to infinite limits as they
      did to finite limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the algebraic methods already discussed, for
      infinite limits there is a powerful technique called asymptotic
      analysis. In practice, this is the most commonly used approach
      to infinite limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Asymptotic analysis interprets limit at infinity as a
      measurement of the growth of functions. The functions <m>f_1(x)
      = x</m>, <m>f_2(x) = x^2</m> and <m>f_3(x) = e^x</m> all get
      very large as <m>x</m> gets very large; they all grow.
      Asymptotic analysis asks which of these functions grows faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The limit of a ratio of function <m>\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m> is
      asking essentially the same question. By looking at the ratio
      of two functions as <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m>, we ar
      implicitly asking which grows faster. If <m>g</m> grows faster,
      then the denominator should outpace the numerator, and the limit
      should tend to <m>0</m>. If <m>f</m> grows faster, then the
      numerator should outpace the denominator and the limit should
      tend to <m>\infty</m>. If <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> has roughly the
      same growth, then the limit should settle to some finite value
      larger than <m>0</m>. This leads to the notion of asymptotic order.

    <title>Asymptotic Order</title>
    <p>
      In asymptotic analysis, we start with a quotient limit.

        \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If this limit is <m>0</m>, then we say that <m>g</m> has
            greater asymptotic order than <m>f</m>. Alternatively, we
            say that <m>g</m> grows faster than or <m>g</m> dominates
            <m>f</m> as <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m>.

        <li>
          <p>
            If this limit is <m>\infty</m>, then we say that <m>f</m>
            has greater asymptotic order than <m>g</m>.
            Alternatively, we say that <m>f</m> grows faster than or
            <m>f</m> dominates <m>g</m>.

          <p>
            If this limit is finite but non-zero, we say that <m>f</m>
            and <m>g</m> have the same asymptotic order.
            Alternatively, .we say that <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> grow at
            the same asymptotic rate and neither dominates. 
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      With this definition, we can evaluate many limits by just
      knowing which functions have greater or lesser asymptotic
      order.

      Here are several rules for asymptotic order of functions. Many
      of these are obvious, but some require more work to establish.
      The proofs of these statements are not included in this course.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            A constant function <m>f(x) = c</m> has a lower asymptotic
            order than any increasing function. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Any multiple of a function <m>c f(x)</m> has the same
            asymptotic order as the original function <m>f(x)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The logarithm <m>f(x) = \ln x</m> grows slower than any
            function <m>f(x) = x^r</m> for <m>r > 0</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The function <m>f(x) = x^r</m> grows slower than <m>g(x) =
            x^s</m> as long as <m>0 \lt r\lt s</m>. In particular,
            polynomials of lower degree grow slower than polynomials
            of higher degree.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The exponential function <m>f(x) = e^x</m> grows faster
            than <m>g(x) = x^r</m> for any <m>r</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The function <m>f(x) = x^x</m> grows faster than <m>g(x) =

          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      These are the most common types of functions we will consider.
      We can summarize this in a list of asymptotic orders: in the
      following list <sq><m>f\lt g</m></sq> means that <m>f</m> grows
      slower than <m>g</m>.
      <me>
        c \lt  \ln x \lt  \ldots \lt  x^{\frac{1}{3}} \lt
        x^{\frac{1}{2}} \lt  x \lt  x^2 \lt  x^3 \lt  \ldots \lt  e^x
        \lt  x^x \lt  \ldots
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the basic list and is something you will either memorize
      or frequently reference for many limits in this course. There
      are other functions at the top of this list which grow faster
      than <m>x^x</m>, but they are not frequently used.

    <title>Asymptotic Ranking, Sums and Product</title>
    <p>
      In quotient limits, <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> may be more
      complicated than the simple functions in our asymptotic ranking.
      We have a two useful rules to help us work with <m>f</m> and
      <m>g</m> which are combinations of pieces of various asymptotic
      order.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>f = f_1 + f_2 + f_3 + \ldots + f_n</m> then the
            asymptotic order of <m>f</m> is the maximum of the
            asymptotic order of the <m>f_i</m>.  This means that in a
            sum or difference, we only need to consider the fastest
            growing pieces. We can simply ignore all the rest.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I don't have as precise a rule for product. Just know that
            product of growing functions increase the asymptotic
            order. <m>xe^x</m> has greater asymptotic order than
            <m>e^x</m>.

      To evaluate a limit of the form
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} 
      </me>
      we look at the asymptotic order. If <m>f</m> has a greater
      asymptotic order, the limit is <m>\infty</m> or <m>-\infty</m>
      (depending on the sign of the fraction as <m>x</m> gets large.
      If <m>g</m> has a greater asymptotic, the limit is zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> have the same
      asymptotic order, the value of the limit is the ration of the
      <em>leading coefficients</em>. The leading coefficients are the
      coefficients which sit in front of the term with the highest
      asymptotic order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that none of the information associated to the pieces of
      lower asymptotic order matters at all. No matter how large
      the constants may be, only the asymptotic order tells us which
      pieces are important.

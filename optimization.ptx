    <title>Extreme Values of Models</title>
    <p>
      Now that I understand how to find extrema using derivatives, I
      can use this technique to solve optimization problems. An
      optimization problem is any problem in applied mathematics where
      the goal is the optimal value of function, either expressed as a
      minimum or a maximum. The method for finding extrema is
      unchagned; most of the challenge in optimization problems is
      translating the problem into an appropriate function so that we
      can use derivatives.

          A very classic (if somewhat artificial and contrived)
          example of an optmization problem is maximing the area of a
          rectangle with fixed perimeter. Let's say that <m>P</m> is
          the fixed perimeter and the rectangle has height <m>h</m>
          and length <m>l</m>, as in <xref
          ref="figure-fixed-perimeter-rectangle" />.

              label("$b$",(2.5,0),S);
              label("Area $A=ab$",(0.5,1),E);
              label("Perimeter $P=2a+2b$",(0.5,2),E);
              label("Constant",(3.5,2),E);
              label("Unknown",(3.5,1),E);

        <p>
          I want to maximize area, so I will eventually be
          differentiating an area function. However, the area
          function is <m>A = ab</m>, which has two variables. I need
          to use the perimeter restriction to eliminate one of the
          variables. I know <m>P = 2a + 2b</m> so <m>a = \frac{P}{2}
          - b</m>. If I substitute for <m>a</m> in the area
          function, I get a single variable area function <m>A(b)</m>.
          <me>
            A(b) = b \left( \frac{P}{2} - b \right)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I can optimize. The derivative is <m>A^\prime(b) =
          \frac{P}{2} - 2b</m>. This vanishes when <m>b =
          \frac{P}{4}</m>. I can test that the critical point is a
          maximum. Unsurprisingly, the result shows that a square
          (where both <m>b</m> and <m>a</m> are exactly one quarter of
          the perimeter) maximizes area.

      To hopefully get to some less contrived examples, I want to use
      optimized distances as examples. In this section, I'll be asking
      for the minimum distance between some fixed point and some
      locus in the plane. First, let me review distances between
      points in the plane. If I have points with coordinates 
      <m>(a,b)</m> and <m>(c,d)</m>, the distance between then is
      given by the pythagoreaon theorem: <m>\sqrt{(c-a)^2 + (b-d)^2}</m>
      This is illustrated in <xref
      ref="figure-distance-between-points" />.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distance function is a well defined function which we can
      use to do optimization problems. That said, the square root is
      difficult to work with, particular if I need to differentiate.
      For distance problems, I am going to make use of a very
      convenient trick. If two points are at an optimized distance
      (closest or most distance in some situation), then the  square
      of the distance will also be smallest or
      largest. Obviously, the square of the distance is a different
      number, but it is optimized at the same place that distance is
      optmized. For this reason, I will optimize the square of
      distance: <m>(c-a)^2 + (b-d)^2</m>. Having removed the square
      root, this is a much easier function to work with. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The setup of these distance problems is this: I have a fixed
      point <m>(a,b)</m> and a locus in the variables <m>x</m> and
      <m>y</m>. The distance squared function from a point on the
      locus to the fixed point is 
      <me>
        d(x,y)  = (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2
      </me>
      However, this is a function of two variables, which I don't know
      how to work with. How do I solve this? I use the locus. I solve
      for one of the two variables (whichever seems more convenient)
      and then replace that variable in the distance squared function.
      That will give me a function only in <m>x</m> or <m>y</m>. Then
      I will proceed to optimze that function, which will give me
      either the <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> coordinate of the
      closest/farthest point. Finally, I use the locus to find the
      other coordinate of these points. I can illustrate this in an
      example.

          I conclude that there is a minimum at

          <m>\frac{(\sqrt[3]{32})^2}{4}</m>. The closest point on the
          parabola to <m>(4,2)</m> is <m>P = \left( \sqrt[3]{32},
          \frac{(\sqrt[3]{32})^2}{4} \right)</m>. <xref

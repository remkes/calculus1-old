    <title>Three Steps</title>
    <p>
      There is a three step procedure to calculating limits.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            First, try to evaluate the function at the limit point.
            For our standard elementary functions (polynomials, roots,
            trig, exponentials, logarithms, etc.), the limit at a
            point in the domain is just the value of the function.
            This is a property called continuity, which I will discuss
            in more detail in <xref ref="section-continuity" />.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If the first method fails, try to analyze the piece of the
            limit to see if a direct conclusion is possible. Even
            though all three steps have logic to them, I'll call this
            the logical analysis step. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If both methods fail, the limit is called an
            <term>indeterminate form</term>. In this case, I need to
            use various algebraic tricks (factoring, expanding,
            multiplying by conjugates, trig identities) and rules for
            manipulating limits to change the limit into a more
            approachable form.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <title>Limit Rules</title>
    <p>
      The third step referred to the rules for manipulating limits,
      which I will now state. These rules mostly tell me that limits
      work well with the standard operations of arithmetic.  Let
      <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> be functions with limits defined at
      <m>x=a</m> and let <m>c</m> be a constant. (In the quotient
      limit, assume <m>g(x) \neq 0</m>, and in the exponential limit,
      assume <m>f(x) > 0</m>.)
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) + g(x) \amp  = \lim_{x
          \rightarrow a} f(x) + \lim_{x \rightarrow a} g(x)
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) - g(x) \amp  = \lim_{x
          \rightarrow a} f(x) - \lim_{x \rightarrow a} g(x)
        </mrow>

          \lim_{x \rightarrow a} c f(x) \amp  = c \lim_{x \rightarrow
          a} f(x)

        <mrow>
          \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) g(x) \amp  = \lim_{x \rightarrow
          a} f(x) \lim_{x \rightarrow a} g(x)
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \amp  =
          \frac{\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x)} {\lim_{x \rightarrow a}
          g(x)}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \lim_{x \rightarrow a} (f(x))^c \amp  = (\lim_{x \rightarrow
          a} f(x))^c
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the limit rules, there are two special limits
      that are frequently useful. The second limit can be taken as a
      definition of the exponential base <m>e</m>.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} \amp  = 1

          \amp  = e

    <title>Examples</title>
    <p>
      In the examples, I demonstrate each of the three steps in the
      limit calculation process, as well as the use of the limit rules
      to splits limits up over arithmetic.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The limit
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 3} \frac{x^2 + 9x - 15}{x+7}
          </me>
          can be directly evaluated. The function is perfectly well
          defined at <m>x=3</m>. The value of the limit is just the
          value of the function.
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 3} \frac{x^2 + 9x - 15}{x+7} =
            \frac{3^2 + 9(3) - 15}{3 + 7} = \frac{21}{10} 
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The limit 
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow -2} \frac{x+4}{x+2} 
          </me>
          cannot be directly evaluated due to division by zero.
          However, I can work this out logically. The numerator
          approaches <m>4 + 2 = 6</m>, so I can think of it as some
          number very close to <m>6</m>. The denominator is becoming
          very close to zero. If I take a number very close to
          <m>6</m> and divide by a very small number, I get a very
          large number. As I divide by smaller and smaller numbers,
          I get larger and larger numbers. I conclude that the limit
          diverges, getting larger and larger without bound. Since
          <m>x \rightarrow -2</m> comes from both sides of the
          numberline, the denominator (and hence the whole limit)
          could be either 
          positive and negative, depending on the side of
          approach. I can write this conclusion in a couple ways.
          First, I can explicitly show that this diverges to either
          positive or negative infinity (that this grows without bound
          either in the positive or negative direction depending on
          which side of the limit is considered). 
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow -2} \frac{x+4}{x+2} = \pm \infty
          </me>
          Second, we could also simply write that the limit doesn't
          exist. This is less precise, but still correct. 
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow -2} \frac{x+4}{x+2} \text{ DNE}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The limit
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 7} \frac{x^2 - 4x - 21}{x^2 + 3x - 70}
          </me>
          cannot be evaluated due to division by zero. I also can't
          work this out by just logical analysis of the pieces, since
          both the numerator and denominator are approaching zero.
          This is an indeterminate form, so I need to do some algebra
          to figure it out. I'm going to factor both quadratics. 
          <me>
            = \lim_{x \rightarrow 7} \frac{(x-7)(x+3)}{(x-7)(x+10)}
          </me>
          Then I can cancel of the <m>(x-7)</m> terms. This is going
          to remove the division by zero problem, which is my goal.
          With indeterminate forms, I'm always trying to remove the
          problem that prevents me from either evaluating directly or
          using logic analysis of the pieces to determine the limit.
          <me>
            = \lim_{x \rightarrow 7} \frac{x+3}{x+10}
          </me>
          Now I can just evaluate the limit, since there is no more
          division by zero.
          <me>
            = \frac{10}{17} 
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 1} x \left( \frac{x^2-1}{x-1} -
            \frac{3}{x-4} \right) 
          </me>
          This limit has various pieces combined together with
          arithmetic. I can use the limit rules to split it up.
          First, I'll split up the product.
          <me>
            = \left( \lim_{x \rightarrow 1} x\right) \lim_{x
            \rightarrow 1} \left( \frac{x^2-1}{x-1} -
            \frac{3}{x-4} \right) 
          </me>
          Then the first limit evaluates to <m>1</m>. I'll use the
          limit rules again to split up the difference in the second
          limit.
          <me>
            = 1 \left( \lim_{x \rightarrow 1} \frac{x^2-1}{x-1} -
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 1} \frac{3}{x-4} \right) 
          </me>
          The second limit can be directly evaluated. The first limit
          needs some work, so I factor its numerator.
          <me>
            = \left( \lim_{x \rightarrow 1} \frac{(x-1)(x+1)}{x-1} -
            \frac{3}{-3} \right) 
          </me>
          Then I can cancel the <m>(x-1)</m> term in the remaining limit.
          <me>
            = \lim_{x \rightarrow 1} (x + 1) + 1   
          </me>
          Finally, I can now evaluate the remaining limit and finish
          the whole problem. 
          <me>
            = 2 + 1 = 3
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The limit
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{x^2 + \sin x}{x} 
          </me>
          is an indeterminate form. I can use the limit rules to break
          it into two limits. 
          <me>
            = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{x^2}{x} + 
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} 
          </me>
          In the first limit, I can cancel an <m>x</m>. The second is
          one of the two special limits I mentioned above, so I just
          use its known value. Then I can evaluate the last remiaining
          limit to finish the problem. 
          <me>
            = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} x + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>

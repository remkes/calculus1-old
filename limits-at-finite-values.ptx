    <title>Three Steps</title>
    <p>
      There is a three step procedure to calculating limits.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            First, try to evaluate the function at the limit point.
            For our standard elementary functions (polynomials, roots,
            trig, exponentials, logarithms, etc.), the limit at a
            point in the domain is just the value of the function.
            This is a property called continuity, which I will discuss
            in more detail in <xref ref="section-continuity" />.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If the first method fails, try to work out logically what
            the limit should do.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If both methods fail, the limit is called an
            <em>indeterminate form</em>. In this case, we need to
            use various algebraic tricks (factoring, expanding,
            multiplying by conjugates, trig identities) and rules for
            manipulating limits to change the limit into a more
            approachable form.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <title>Limit Rules</title>
    <p>
      The third step referred to the rules for manipulating limits,
      which we will now state. Let <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> be functions
      with limits defined at <m>x=a</m> and let <m>c</m> be a
      constant. (In the quotient limit, assume <m>g(x) \neq 0</m>, and
      in the exponential limit, assume <m>f(x) > 0</m>.)
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) + g(x) \amp  = \lim_{x
          \rightarrow a} f(x) + \lim_{x \rightarrow a} g(x)
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) - g(x) \amp  = \lim_{x
          \rightarrow a} f(x) - \lim_{x \rightarrow a} g(x)
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \lim_{x \rightarrow a} c f(x) \amp  = c \lim_{x \rightarrow
          a} f(x)
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) g(x) \amp  = \lim_{x \rightarrow
          a} f(x) \lim_{x \rightarrow a} g(x)
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \amp  =
          \frac{\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x)} {\lim_{x \rightarrow a}
          g(x)}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \lim_{x \rightarrow a} (f(x))^c \amp  = (\lim_{x \rightarrow
          a} f(x))^c
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the limit rules, there are two limits that are
      frequently useful. The second limit can be taken as a
      definition of the exponential base <m>e</m>.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} \amp  = 1
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \lim_{x \rightarrow 0^+} \left( 1 + x \right)^{\frac{1}{x}}
          \amp  = e

    <title>Examples</title>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The limit
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 3} \frac{x^2 + 9x - 15}{x+7}
          </me>
          can be directly evaluated. The function is perfectly well
          defined at <m>x=3</m>. The value of the limit (what the
          function approaches) is just the value of the function.
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 3} \frac{x^2 + 9x - 15}{x+7} =
            \frac{3^2 + 9(3) - 15}{3 + 7} = \frac{21}{10} 
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The limit 
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow -2} \frac{x+4}{x+2} 
          </me>
          cannot be directly evaluated due to division by zero.
          However, we can work this out logically. The numerator
          approaches <m>4+2 = 6</m>, so we can think of it as some
          number very close to <m>6</m>. The denominator is becoming
          very close to zero. If we take a number very close to
          <m>6</m> and divide by a very small number, we get a very
          large number. As we divide by smaller and smaller numbers,
          we get larger and larger numbers. We conclude that the limit
          diverges, getting larger and larger without bound. Since
          <m>x \rightarrow -2</m> comes from both sides of the
          numberline, the denominator (and hence the whole limit) is
          both positive and negative, depending on the side of
          approach. We can write this conclusion in a couple ways.
          First, we can explicitly show that this diverges to either
          positive or negative infinity.
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow -2} \frac{x+4}{x+2} = \pm \infty
          </me>
          Second, we could also simply write that the limit doesn't
          exist. This is less precise, but still correct. 
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow -2} \frac{x+4}{x+2} \text{ DNE}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The limit
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 7} \frac{x^2 - 4x - 21}{x^2 + 3x - 70}
          </me>
          cannot be evaluated due to division by zero. We also can't
          work this out logically, since both the numerator and
          denominator are approaching zero. This is an indeterminate
          form, so we need to do some algebra to figure it out. I'm
          going to factor both quadratics. 
          <me>
            = \lim_{x \rightarrow 7} \frac{(x-7)(x+3)}{(x-7)(x+10)}
          </me>
          Then I can cancel of the <m>(x-7)</m> terms. This is going
          to remove the division by zero problem, which is my goal.
          With indeterminate forms, I'm always trying to remove the
          problem that prevents my from either evaluating directly or
          using simple logic to determine the limit.
          <me>
            = \lim_{x \rightarrow 7} \frac{x+3}{x+10}
          </me>
          Now I can just evaluate the limit, since there is no more
          division by zero.
          <me>
            = \frac{10}{17} 
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The limit
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 1} x \left( \frac{x^2-1}{x-1} -
            \frac{3}{x-4} \right) 
          </me>
          This limit have various pieces combined together with
          arithmetic. We can use the limit rules to split it up.
          First, I'll split up the product.
          <me>
            = \left( \lim_{x \rightarrow 1} x\right) \lim_{x
            \rightarrow 1} \left( \frac{x^2-1}{x-1} -
            \frac{3}{x-4} \right) 
          </me>
          Then the first limit evaluates to <m>1</m>. I'll use the
          limit rules again to split up the sum in the second limit. 
          <me>
            = 1 \left( \lim_{x \rightarrow 1} \frac{x^2-1}{x-1} -
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 1} \frac{3}{x-4} \right) 
          </me>
          The second limit can be directly evaluated. The first limit
          needs some work, so I factor its numerator.
          <me>
            = \left( \lim_{x \rightarrow 1} \frac{(x-1)(x+1)}{x-1} -
            \frac{3}{-3} \right) 
          </me>
          Then I can cancel a term in the remaining limit.
          <me>
            = \lim_{x \rightarrow 1} (x + 1) + 1   
          </me>
          Finally, I can now evaluate this limit and finish the whole
          problem. 
          <me>
            = 2 + 1 = 3
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The limit
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{x^2 + \sin x}{x} 
          </me>
          is an indeterminate form. I can use the limit rules to break
          it into two limits. 
          <me>
            = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{x^2}{x} + 
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} 
          </me>
          In the first limit, I can cancel an <m>x</m>. The second is
          one of the important limits I mentioned previous, so I just
          use its known value. 
          <me>
            = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} x + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1
          </me>
        </p>

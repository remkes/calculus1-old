      Calculus is a branch of mathematics concerned with the behaviour
      of functions. In this introductory/review section, I want to
      make sure to present a solid conceptual foundation of functions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three major definitions or interpretations of
      functions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      First, a function is like a machine which acts on things
      (usually, but not necessarily, numbers). Functions are agents
      which perform certain action. The function <m>f(x) =
      x^2</m> from <m>\RR \rightarrow \RR</m> is a process which takes
      a number and produces the square of that number
      think of <m>f</m> as the thing that squares numbers. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, a more abstract understanding of a function is as a rule
      that assigns something in one set to something in another. In
      order to explain this understanding, I first need to review sets. 
    </p>
    <p>
      A <em>set</em> is any collection of things; the things in a set
      are called its <em>elements</em> While most of our sets will be
      sets of numbers, apriori a set can have any kind of elements.
      Particularly useful sets for this course are the standard number
      sets (<m>\NN</m>, the natural numbers; <m>\ZZ</m>, the integers;
      <m>\QQ</m>, the rational number, <m>\RR</m>, the real numbers),
      open inverals <m>(a,b)</m> and closed interval <m>[a,b]</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I'll return to the second understanding of functions. Let
      <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be sets. A <em>function</em> <m>f: A
      \rightarrow B</m> is a rule that assigns an element of <m>B</m>
      to each element of <m>A</m>. The set <m>A</m> is called the
      domain. The range of the function is the subset of <m>B</m>
      consisting of all outputs of the function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, functions encode relationships and dependencies.
      For a function <m>f: A \rightarrow B</m>, I can thing
      of the elements of <m>B</m> depending on the elements of
      <m>A</m>. If I say that population growth is a function of
      food supply, I mean that there is a function which goes from
      numbers representing food suply to numbers representing growth
      rates. That function encodes the dependance of growth on food
      supply.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the three concepts, function are also visualized
      by graphs. (There is a library of functions in the common
      materials which shows the graphs of many frequently used
      functions.) Visualizing the action of a function by its graph is
      a very convenient way to remember the function and its
      properties.
    </p>

    <title>Functions on <m>\RR</m></title>
    <p>
      For the purposes of this course, I will present functions
      defined on <m>\RR</m> and its subsets. For most functions, I
      will not explicitly describe a domain; the domain of the
      function will implicitly be the largest subset of real numbers
      where the function applies. Likewise the range will implicitly
      be the subset of all possible outputs of the function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Determining the domain of a function on <m>\RR</m> means
      avoiding illegal mathematical actions. There are three common
      restrictions
    </p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>
        I cannot divide by zero.
      </li>
      <li>
        I cannot take even roots of negative numbers.
      </li>
      <li>
        I cannot take logarithms of negative numbers or zero.
      </li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>
      There are special domain restrictions for certain functions,
      such as inverse trig functions, but these three cover the
      vast majority of functions I will be presenting. Determining
      the domain of a function <m>f</m> means excluding real numbers
      which would lead to one of the three problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, should I wish to, I can put additional domain
      restrictions on a function. Functions of time cannot extend
      infinitely back in time, so I will usually stipulate a starting
      time; the domain of the function will be after that starting
      time. Restricting domains is also useful to make a function
      invertible.

    <p>
      Calculus is a branch of mathematics concerned with the behaviour
      of functions. In this introductory/review section, I want to
      make sure to present a solid conceptual foundation of functions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three major definitions or interpretations of
      functions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, a function is a machine which acts on things
      (usually, but not necessarily, numbers). The function <m>f(x) =
      x^2</m> from <m>\RR \rightarrow \RR</m> is a rule which assignes
      to each number its square. However, it's often more natural to
      think of <m>f</m> as the thing that squares numbers. Functions
      are agents which perform actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to define functions, I first need to define sets. A
      <em>set</em> is any collection of things; the things in a set
      are called its <em>elements</em> While most of our sets will be
      sets of numbers, apriori a set can have any kind of elements.
      Particularly useful sets for this course are the standard number
      sets (<m>\NN</m>, the natural numbers; <m>\ZZ</m>, the integers;
      <m>\QQ</m>, the rational number, <m>\RR</m>, the real numbers),
      open inverals <m>(a,b)</m> and closed interval <m>[a,b]</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be sets. A <em>function</em> <m>f: A
      \rightarrow B</m> is a rule that assigns an element of <m>B</m>
      to each element of <m>A</m>. The set <m>A</m> is called the
      domain. The range of the function is the subset of <m>B</m>
      consisting of all outputs of the function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, functions encode relationships and dependencies.
      For a function <m>f: A \rightarrow B</m>, I can thing
      of the elements of <m>B</m> depending on the elements of
      <m>A</m>. If I say that population growth is a function of
      food supply, I mean that there is a function which goes from
      numbers representing food suply to numbers representing growth
      rates. That function encodes the dependance of growth on food
      supply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, function are visualized by graphs. (There is a
      library of functions in the common materials which shows the
      graphs of many frequently used functions.)
      Visualizing the action of a function by its graph is
      a very convenient way to remember the function and its
      properties.
    </p>

    <title>Functions on <m>\RR</m></title>
    <p>
      For the purposes of calculus, I will present functions
      defined on <m>\RR</m> and its subsets. For most functions, we
      will not explicitly stipulate a domain; the domain of the
      function will implicitly be the largest subset of real numbers
      where the function applies. Likewise the range will be the
      subset of all possible outputs of the function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Determining the domain of a function on <m>\RR</m> means
      avoiding illegal mathematical actions. There are three common
      restrictions.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            I cannot divide by zero.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I cannot take even roots of negative numbers.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I cannot take logarithms of negative numbers or zero.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are special domain restrictions for certain functions,
      such as inverse trig functions, but the main three cover the
      vast majority of functions I will be presenting. Determining
      the domain of a function <m>f</m> means excluding real numbers
      which would lead to one of the three problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, should I wish to, I can put additional domain
      restrictions on a function. Functions of time cannot extend
      infinitely back in time, so I usually stipulate a starting
      time; the domain of the function will be after that starting
      time. Restricting domains is also useful to make a function
      invertible.

        Find the intersection points of the following pairs of objects.
        (Where you have square roots, you can leave your answers in
        square root form <mdash /> you don't need to evaluate to
        demical approximations.) (20)

      <p><ol>
        <li>
          The line <m>x + y - 2 = 0</m> and the line <m> x - y - 3 =
          0</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The line <m>y = 2x + 4</m> and the horizontal line through
          <m>(0,6)</m>
        </li>
        <li>
          The line <m>y = 6x - 2</m> and the parabola <m>y = 4x^2</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The line <m>x + y - 2 = 0</m> and the ellipse <m>x^2 +
          \frac{y^2}{4}</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The hyperbola <m>\frac{x^2}{4} - \frac{y^2}{9} = 1</m> and
          the parabola <m>y = 2x^2 </m>. (Hint: if you get a degree 4
          equation, try a different approach or substitution). 
        </li>
      </ol></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      What are the intersection point(s) of all ellipses of the form
      <m>\frac{x^2}{16} + \frac{y^2}{b^2}</m> where <m>b</m> ranges
      through the positive real numbers? (4)

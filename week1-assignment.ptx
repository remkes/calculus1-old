        Find the intersection points of the following pairs of curves.
        (Where you have square roots, you can leave your answers in
        square root form <mdash /> you don't need to evaluate to
        demical approximations.) (16)

        <li>
          The line <m>x = 4</m> and the ellipse <m>\frac{x^2}{25} +
          \frac{y^2}{36} = 1</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The line <m>y = 3x</m> and the parabola <m>y = x^2 - 9x -
          4</m>.  
        </li>
        <li>
          The ellipse <m>x^2 + \frac{y^2}{4} = 1</m> and
          the circle <m>x^2 + y^2 = 4</m>. 
        </li>
        <li>
          The hyperbola <m>\frac{x^2}{9} - \frac{y^2}{4} = 1</m> and
          the line <m>x = 0</m>.

      Draw three examples of two conics meeting at exactly three
      points. (The examples should each have a different structure or
      pattern). It is necessary that at least one of the three points
      is a tangential intersection? (6)

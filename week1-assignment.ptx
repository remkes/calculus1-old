        Find the intersection points of the following pairs of curves.
        (Where you have square roots, you can leave your answers in
        square root form <mdash /> you don't need to evaluate to
        demical approximations.) (12)

      <p><ol>
        <li>
          The line <m>y=x-5</m> and the hyperbola <m>y^2 - x^2 =
          5</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The ellipse <m>\frac{x^2}{4} + \frac{y^2}{16} = 1</m> and
          the parabola <m>y = \frac{x^2}{4}</m>. 
        </li>
        <li>
          The hyperbola <m>\frac{-x^2}{6} + \frac{y^2}{27} = 1</m> and
          the parabola <m>y = \frac{-3x^2}{4}</m>.

      What are all the ways two circles can intersect. Give
      examples, either by drawing or by expressing in intersections
      algebraically. (4)

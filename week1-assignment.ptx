        Find the intersection points of the following pairs of curves. (
        Where you have square roots, you can leave your answers in
        square root form <mdash /> you don't need to evaluate to
        demical approximations.) (12)
      <ol>
        <li>
          The parabola <m>y = x^2</m> and the line <m>x + y = -6</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The circle <m>x^2 + y^2 = 9</m> and the hyperbola <m>x^2
          -y^2 = 1</m>. 
        </li>
        <li>
          The parabola <m>y=\frac{x^2}{2}</m> and the line through
          <m>(1,1)</m> with slope <m>4</m>.
        </li>

      Consider the ellipse <m>\frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1</m>.  A line in
      <m>\RR^2</m> can intersect this ellipse in one of three ways:
      not at all, at one point tangent to the ellipse, and at two
      points.  For each of the three cases, find a line which is an
      example of that case. (Write the equations of the lines and show
      your calculation to verity the intersection behaviour of each
      line.) (6)

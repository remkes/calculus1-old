        Find the intersection points of the following pairs of objects.
        (Where you have square roots, you can leave your answers in
        square root form <mdash /> you don't need to evaluate to
        demical approximations.) (20)

        <li>
          The line <m>y = -2x + 7</m> and the circle <m>x^2 + y
          ^2 = 40</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The parabola <m>y = x^2 + 4</m> and parabola <m>y =
          -x^2 - 3</m> 
        </li>
        <li>
          The hyperbola <m>\frac{x^2}{16} + \frac{y^2}{25} = 1</m> and
          the circle <m>x^2 + y^2 = 1</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The circle <m>(x-2)^2 + y^2 = 4</m> and the circle parabola 
          <m>x=y^2</m>. 
        </li>
      </ol></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      How many ways can two hyperbolae intersect? You may assume both
      are oriented to open along the same axis. Draw some examples,
      but you do not need to provide equations for your examples. (6)

        Find the intersection points of the following pairs of curves. (
        Where you have square roots, you can leave your answers in
        square root form <mdash /> you don't need to evaluate to
        demical approximations.) (12)
      <ol>
        <li>
          The ellipse <m>\frac{x^2}{9} + \frac{y^2}{4} = 1 </m> and the
          hyperbola <m>\frac{x^2}{9} - \frac{y^2}{4} = 1</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The parbola <m>y = 4x^2</m> and the line  <m>y = 3x - 1</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The circle <m>x^2 + y^2 = 9</m> and the parabola <m>y =
          x^2</m>.
        </li>

        What are all the ways that two parabolae (not necessarily
        centred at the origin) can intersect? (6)

        Find the intersection points of the following pairs of objects.
        (Where you have square roots, you can leave your answers in
        square root form <mdash /> you don't need to evaluate to
        demical approximations.) (20)

          The line <m>y = 4x - 6</m> and the parabola <m> y = -2x^2 +
          4x + 4</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The circle <m>x^2 + (y-3)^2 = 9</m> and parabola <m>y =
          \frac{x^2}{10}</m> (Hint: If you get a degree 4 equation,
          try something different.)
        </li>
        <li>
          The ellipse <m>\frac{x^2}{4} + \frac{y^2}{16}</m> and the
          line <m>x=1</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The circle <m>(x-4)^2 + (y-5)^2</m> and the circle
          <m>(x+3)^2 + (y+2)^2 = 4</m>. (Hint: this question doesn't
          need a long and complicated calculation. Look for an easier
          way to answer it.) 
        </li>
        <li>
          The hyperbola <m>\frac{x^2}{9} - \frac{y^2}{4} = 1</m> and
          the ellipse <m>\frac{x^2}{9} + \frac{y^2}{4} = 1 </m>.
          (Hint: if you get a degree 4 equation or an equation with
          difficult square roots, try a different approach or
          substitution).

    <li>
      At how many points can a line intersect a quadratic? Draw
      examples to show the different number of intersection points.
      (No equations are needed, just a simple drawing of the shapes.)
      Do the same for a line and a cubic, and then a line and a
      quartic. Make a proposition about the number of possible
      intersection points of a line and a degree <m>n</m> polynomial.
      (You don't have to argue for this proposition; just make a
      hypothesis based on the first three cases.) (6)

    <title>Derivatives in Limits</title>
    <p>
      The first application of derivatives is a strange reversal:
      after using limits to define derivatives, I am going to use
      derivatives to calculate limits. L'Hôpital's rule is a method
      that applies to indeterminante form limits of type
      <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m> or type <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>. (I
      defined these types of limits in <xref
      ref="section-asymptotic-analysis" />.) In this case, if <m>f</m>
      and <m>g</m> are differentiable functions, L'Hôpital's rule
      states that the limit is preserved if I differentiate both
      numerator and denominator.
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \rightarrow
        a} \frac{f^\prime(x)}{g^\prime(x)}
      </me>
      This is particularly useful in asymptotic analysis, where many
      limits (as <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m>) have type
      <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m>. Indeed, L'Hôpital's rule can be
      used to prove many of the ideas in asymptotic analysis.

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the claim that <m>\ln x</m> is asymptotically
          slower than <m>\sqrt{x}</m>.
          I will  use L'Hôpital's rule to prove the claim. Both the
          numerator and the denominator here approach <m>\infty</m>,
          so the rule applies. I differentiate both
          numerator and denominator, then simplify the nested
          fraction. The result is a limit I know how to do, where the
          numerator is constant and the denominator becomes very
          large. 
        </p>
        <me>
          \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\ln x}{\sqrt{x}} =
          \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty}
          \frac{\frac{1}{x}}{\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}} = \lim_{x
          \rightarrow \infty} \frac{2 \sqrt{x}}{x} = \lim_{x
          \rightarrow \infty} \frac{2}{\sqrt{x}} = 0
        </me>
        <p>
          A limit of <m>0</m> means that the numerator has lower
          asymptotic order than the denominator; I was justified in
          <xref ref="subsection-asymptotic-ranking" /> when I 
          said that the logarithm <m>\ln x</m> is asymptotically
          slower that <m>\sqrt{x}</m>.

    <title>Derivatives in Limits</title>
    <p>
      The first application of derivatives is a strange reversal:
      after using limits to define derivatives, we are going to use
      derivatives to calculate limits. L'H么pital's rule is a
      method that applies to limits of type
      <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m> or type <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>. In
      this case, if <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are differentiable
      functions, L'H么pital's rule states that the limit is
      preserved if we differentiate both numerator and denominator.
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \rightarrow
        a} \frac{f^\prime(x)}{g^\prime(x)}
      </me>

    <p>
      This is particular useful in asymptotic analysis, where many
      limits (as <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m>) have type
      <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the claim that <m>\ln x</m> is asymptotically
          slower than <m>\sqrt{x}</m>.
          We use L'H么pital's rule to prove the claim.
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\ln x}{\sqrt{x}} =
            \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty}
            \frac{\frac{1}{x}}{\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}} = \lim_{x
            \rightarrow \infty} \frac{2 \sqrt{x}}{x} = \lim_{x
            \rightarrow \infty} \frac{2}{\sqrt{x}} = 0
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          A limit of <m>0</m> means that the numerator has lower
          asymptotic order than the denominator; we were justified in
          saying that the logarithm <m>\ln x</m> is asymptotically
          slower that <m>\sqrt{x}</m>.

  <title>Ratios with Equivalent Asymptotic Order</title>
  <p>
    In a quotient limit where <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> have the same asymptotic order,
    we look at the <em>leading coefficients</em>.
    The leading coefficients are the coefficients which sit in front of the term with the highest asymptotic order.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{8x^4 + 3x^2 + 4}{14x^4 -
        9x^3 - 50x^2 - 4x - 1}
      </me>
      <p>
        The leading coefficient in the numerator if <m>8</m>,
        and in the denominator is <m>14</m>.
        Only these terms matter, which radically simplifies the limit
        <me>
          \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{8x^4 + 3x^2 + 4}{14x^4 - 9x^3 - 50x^2 - 4x - 1} = \frac{8}{14} = \frac{4}{7}
        </me>
      </p>

        Note that none of the information associated to the pieces of lower asymptotic order matters at all.
        No matter how large the constants may be,
        only the asymptotic order tells us which pieces are important.

    <p>
      Moving from biological examples to physics, the velocity problem
      is one of the basic motivating problems of calculus. Assume we
      have an object moving in one dimension. We describe its
      position as a function <m>p(t)</m> where <m>p</m> is position in
      terms of time <m>t</m>. We want to know its velocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>p(t) = at + b</m> is a linear function, then algebra can
      answer this question. With this linear function, for each unit
      of time we gain <m>a</m> units of distance. The value <m>a</m>
      is the velocity. Geometrically, the velocity is measured by the
      slope of the straight line graph of <m>p(t)</m>. The slope is
      measured by the ratio of the change in <m>p</m>, <m>\Delta
      p</m>, to the change in <m>t</m>, <m>\Delta t</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If slope is the way to measure velocity, then we need a notion
      of slope for non-linear functions as well. The notion comes
      from the idea of tangent lines. A tangent line to a graph is a
      line which touches the graph at one point without crossing it
      (as opposed to a secant line, which crosses the graph twice).
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="figure-secant-line">
      <caption>A Secant Line</caption>
      <image width="60%" source="images/figure12"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The slope of a graph is defined to be the slope of its tangent,
      should such a line exist. The velocity problem is reduced to
      the problem of finding the tangent line (or, more particularly,
      its slope). How do we find a tangent line?  Again, algebra has
      trouble with this. The best that algebra can do is find secant
      lines which approximate a tangent line. We adjust the
      approximation by letting the two points of the secant line come
      closer and closer together, as in the <xref
      ref="figure-secant-approximations1">Figure</xref>. In this way,
      we build an approximation process which can get better an
      better. However, algebra an never finish the process <mdash />
      it can just supply improved approximations.

    <title>The Distance Travelled Problem</title>
    <p>
      Let's consider the opposite problem. Say we have a function
      <m>v(t)</m> which tells us the velocity of an object at any
      point of time. Can we determine the distance the object has
      covered over a period of time?
    </p>

      <image width="60%" source="images/figure14"/>
    </figure>
    <figure xml:id="figure-non-constant-velocity">
      <caption>Non-Constant Velocity</caption>
      <image width="60%" source="images/figure15"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Again, algebra can only answer this question for very simple
      situations. Let's assume that velocity <m>v(t) = c</m> is
      constant. In this case, if we have constant velocity of
      <m>c</m> unit distance for unit time and we have travelled for
      <m>t_0</m> units of time, the distance is just the product
      <m>ct_0</m>. Graphically, the situation is summarized in <xref
      ref="figure-constant-velocity">Figures</xref> and <xref
      ref="figure-non-constant-velocity"></xref>. We can see that the
      distance travelled under constant velocity is the area under the
      velocity graph. To solve the distance travelled problem, we
      have to find areas under curves. Like tangent lines, this is
      not a problem that algebra can easily tackle. However, it can
      approximate areas. Algebra is good at areas of rectangles, so
      we can use rectanges to approximate areas.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="figure-improved-approximation-by-rectangles">
      <caption>Improved Approximation with More Rectangles</caption>
      <image width="60%" source="images/figure17"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The sum of the areas of all the rectangles is reasonable
      approximation to the area under the curve. If we want a better
      approximation, we can divide into smaller rectangles. In this
      way, we set up an approximation process to understand areas
      under curves. Algebra can never completely answer the question,
      but it can get better and better approximations by using more
      and more rectangles in its approximation.

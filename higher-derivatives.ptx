  <title>Higher Derivatives</title>
  <p>
    Starting with a differentiable function <m>f(x)</m>, we used
    derivatives to get a whole new function <m>f^\prime(x)</m> which
    measured the slope of the previous function. This solves the
    velocity problem: if <m>p(t)</m> was position of an object, then
    <m>p^\prime(t)</m> was the velocity of the object.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can continue this process. If <m>f^\prime(x)</m> is still a
    differentiable function itself, we can take another derivative to
    get <m>f^{\prime \prime}(x)</m>. This is called the second
    derivative. The process is exactly the same: we use the same
    limit definition and the same differentiation rules to find this
    second derivative. <m>f^{\prime \prime}(t)</m> is Newton's
    notation for the second derivative; the Leibniz notation is
    <m>\frac{d^2 f}{dx^2}</m>. If <m>p(t)</m> was a position function
    and <m>p^\prime(t)</m> was its velocity (the rate of change of
    position), the <m>p^{\prime \prime}(t)</m> would be the rate of
    change of velocity. That woud be acceleration. Acceleration is
    the second derivative of position.

    This has important implications for physics. Newton's first law
    of motion, <m>F = ma</m>, says that force equals mass times
    acceleration. If force depends on position (as it often does),
    then we can write Newton's first law as a differential equation.
    <me>
      F(p) = m \frac{d^2 p}{dt^2}
    </me>
  </p>

    As with most of the fundanmental equations of physics, Newtonian
    motion is determined by the solution of a differential equation.
    Let's take a more specific example. On the surface of the earth,
    it is assumed that the acceleration due to gravity is constant at
    rougly <m>9.8 m/s^2</m>. We can observe that the flight of
    projectiles is roughly parabolic, that is, height is described by
    a parabola <m>h(t) = at^2 + bt + c</m>. If we differentiate once,
    vertical velocity is <m>h^\prime(t) = 2at + b</m>. If we
    differentiate twice, vertical acceleration is <m>h^{\prime
    \prime}(t) = 2a</m>, which is constant. So parabolic paths fit
    with the notion of a constant acceleration due to gravity. Even
    more, we know that the leading coefficient of those quadratics
    should be roughly <m>a = 4.9</m> to get the constant acceleration
    <m>2a = 9.8m/s^2</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another specific example is Hooke's law. This law describes the
    force caused by a spring; the law states that the force is
    (negatively) proportional to the distance from equalibrium. If
    equalibrium is at <m>p=0</m>, then <m>F = -kp</m>. That gives
    this differential equation:
    <me>
      -kp = m \frac{d^2 p}{dt^2}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    The behaviour of an object on a (perfect, frictionless) spring is
    determined by this differential equation. What is that behaviour?
    We simply have to figure out which function <m>p(t)</m> matches
    this differential equation. In this case, there are two
    solutions:
    <md>
      <mrow>
      p(t) \amp = \sin \left( \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} t \right) \amp
      \text{or} \amp \amp p(t) \amp= \cos \left( \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}
      t \right)
      </mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the sinusoidal functions solve the differential equation, we
    can conclude that an object on a spring should act with a
    sinusoidal behaviour.

        There are other interesting properties of the higher
        derivatvies of trigonometric function.

            f(x) \amp = \sin x
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            f^\prime(x) \amp = \cos x
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            f^{\prime\prime}(x) \amp = -\sin x
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            f^{\prime\prime\prime}(x) \amp = -\cos x

        If we take four derivatives, we get back to the original
        function. The same is true for <m>\cos x</m>, but those two
        functions are unique among functions for this property.

        Each differentiation reduces the degree of the polynomial by
        one, until we eventually get to zero. If we take enough
        derivatives of any polynomial, we will eventually reach zero.

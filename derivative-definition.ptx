      In <xref ref="section-population-growth" />, we defined the
      derivative as the rate of change of a function. In <xref
      ref="section-two-motivating-problems" />, we connected that
      definition to the geometry of slopes of tangent lines and
      constructed a process by which algebra can approximate a tangent
      line by using secant lines. Now that we have limits, we can ask
      for the limit of that approximation process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's say we want the slope of the tangent line at a point
      <m>(a,f(a))</m> on the graph of a function. We can take
      <m>a</m> as one point to define a secant line and let <m>x</m>
      be the other point (with <m>x \neq a</m>). Then the slope of
      the secant line is the difference in output (<m>f(x) - f(a)</m>)
      dividing by the difference in input (<m>x-a</m>).
      <me>
        \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x-a}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We said that we should get better and better approximations to
      the tangent line as <m>x</m> gets closer to <m>a</m>. Now we
      can ask for the limit as <m>x \rightarrow a</m>.
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x-a}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This limit, if it exists, will be the slope of the tangent line.
      It is called the derivative and is the rate of change of the
      function at <m>x=a</m>. <me> f^\prime(a) = \frac{df}{dx} (a) =
      \lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x-a}.
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a slight alteration of the definition, which is useful
      for some calculations. If we let <m>h = x-a</m>, then we can
      write the limit as:
      <me>
        f^\prime(a) = \frac{df}{dx} (a) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0}
        \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This second definition allows us to see that the derivative is
      an entirely new function. At each point <m>x</m> in the domain
      of <m>f</m>, we can ask for the slope of the tangent line. That
      gives a new function:
      <me>
        f^\prime(x) = \frac{df}{dx} = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0}
        \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
      </me>
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsection-operators">
    <title>Differential Operators</title>
    <p>
      We think of the derivative as an operation on functions: it
      takes a function and gives us a new function which measures the
      rate of change of the previous function. This solves the
      velocity problem: if <m>x(t)</m> is a position function, then
      its derivative <m>x^\prime(t)</m> is the velocity function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leibniz notation is useful for thinking of derivatives as
      operators. If we seperate the notation slightly, we can write
      <me>
        \frac{df}{dx} = \frac{d}{dx} f
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      With this notation, we think of <m>\frac{d}{dx}</m> as the
      operator: the thing that takes derivatives. Having notation for
      such an operator is extremely convenient.
    </p>

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-differentiability">
    <title>Differentiability</title>
    <p>
      The limit defining the derivative may not always exist. If it
      does exist at a point <m>a</m> in the domain, we say that
      <m>f</m> is <em>differentiable</em> at the point <m>a</m>. If
      it exists for all points in the domain of <m>f</m>, we say that
      <m>f</m> is a differentiable function. Differentiability
      requires continuity: if a function makes a sudden jump, it
      doesn't make sense to talk about a rate of change and a tangent
      line cannot be defined. Differentiability also requires a
      <sq>smoothness</sq> condition. A function whose graph has sharp
      corners is not differentiable at the sharp corners, because it
      doesn't make sense to define a tangent line at a sharp corner.
      The graph of the function must be smooth. <xref
      ref="figure-differentiability-problems" /> shows how
      a jump or sharp corner makes the choice of a tangent line
      problematic.

    <title>Interpretation</title>
    <p>
      Now that we have a definition of the derivative and
      differentiability, let's review what this all means. The
      derivative has two major interpretation, one geometric and one
      applied.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The derivative measures the slope of a tangent line to a
            function.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The derivative measures the rate of change of a function.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      If a function is differentiable on its domain, that means its
      derivative exists at all points in the domain. In the geometric
      interpretation, this means that the graph of the function has a
      well-defined tangent line at all points in its domain. In the
      applied interpretation, this means that the function has a
      well-defined rate of change at all points in its domain.

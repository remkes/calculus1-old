  <title>Perspectives and Philosophy</title>
  <p>
    In addition to the strictly mathematical material of the course, I
    will try to share some ideas about the philosophy of mathematics,
    the aesthetics of mathematics, and how our own worldview and
    assumptions influence mathematical thought. As several spots in
    the course, I will include short videos on these topics. I will
    ask you to write some reflections on these short videos.

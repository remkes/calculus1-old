    <title>Pointwise Operations</title>
    <p> The most familiar way to put functions together is through the
    conventional operations of arithmetic: addition, subtraction,
    multiplication, division and exponentiation. If <m>f</m> and
    <m>g</m> are functions, then <m>f+g</m>, <m>f-g</m>, <m>f \cdot
    g</m>, <m>\frac{f}{g}</m> and <m>f^g</m> are all functions. They
    may have additional domain restrictions, such as avoiding the
    roots of <m>g</m> in <m>\frac{f}{g}</m>. We call these
    combinations <em>pointwise operations</em> on function.

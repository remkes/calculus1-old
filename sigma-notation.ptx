  <title>Writing Complicated Sums</title>
    <p>
      Sigma notation is a convenient way to write large and complicated
      sums. The name comes from the fact that it uses the upper case
      greek letter sigma: <m>\Sigma</m>. Sigma notation relies on an
      index and expresses the terms of the sum as expression of the
      index. Here is an example to show the general form.
      <me>
        \sum_{k=1}^{34} (k^2 - 4k)  
      </me>
      Let me define the terminology. In the example pressent, <m>k</m>
      is the <term>index</term>. It ranges from <m>1</m> to <m>34</m>
      <mdash /> the numbers that appear above and below the
      <m>\Sigma</m>. These two numbers are called the
      <term>bounds</term>. The bound below the sigma tells where the
      index starts and the bound above the sigma tells where the index
      ends. The expression following the sigma is called the
      <term>term</term>. For each index from the lower bound and
      proceeding to the upper bound (in integer steps), I evaluate the
      expression. Here are some example sums to show how it works.

    <title>Manipulating Sums</title>
    <p>
      There are some important rules for manipulating sigma notation.
      First, sums are (unsurprisingly) linear, so I can split them up
      over addition/subtraction and pull out constants. 
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \sum_{k=1}^n 6k \amp = 6 \sum_{k=1}^n k
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \sum_{k=1}^n (3k^2 + 9k) \amp = 3 \sum_{k=1}^n k^2 + 9
          \sum_{k=1}^n k 
        </mrow>
      </md>
      I can combine sums if the indices match.
      <me>
        \sum_{k=1}^{15} k^2 + \sum_{k=1}^{15} 4k = \sum_{k=1}^{15}
        (k^2 + 4k)
      </me>
      If I want to combine sums when the indices don't match, I have
      to adjust the sums. There are two main methods of adjusting the
      sum. First, I can take out terms.
      <me>
        \sum_{k=1}^{15} k^2 + \sum_{k=3}^{15} 4k = 1^2 + 2^2 +
        \sum_{k=3}^{15} k^2 + \sum_{k=3}^{15} 4k = 5 + \sum_{k=3}^{15}
        (k^2 + 4k)
      </me>
      I can also shift the indices. This might seem tricky, but it's
      easy to remember if you think of balance: whatever I do to the
      index, I have to do the opposite to the expression.  Here I
      shift the index by <m>+2</m>, so the expression is shifted by
      <m>-2</m>.
      <me>
        \sum_{k=3}^{17} 4k = \sum_{k=1}^{15} 4(k+2)
      </me>
      I can use these two manipulations to combine sums if the
      indices don't initially line up.
      <me>
        \sum_{k=1}^{15} k^2 + \sum_{k=3}^{17} 4k = \sum_{k=1}^{15}
        k^2 + \sum_{k=1}^{15} 4(k+2) = \sum_{k=1}^{15} (k^2 + 4k +
        8)
      </me>

      Finally, here are the values for some common sums. These
      expressions will be used, along with the previously stated
      rules, to calculate integrals in the next section.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \sum_{k=1}^n 1 \amp = n
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \sum_{k=1}^n k \amp = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \sum_{k=1}^n k^2 \amp = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \sum_{k=1}^n k^3 \amp = \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \right)^2
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The last sum establishes a interesting result: the sum of the
      first <m>n</m> cubes is always a square. You are welcome to check
      for yourself: the first few sums are <m>1</m>, <m>9</m>,
      <m>36</m>, <m>100</m> and <m>225</m>, all of which are square.

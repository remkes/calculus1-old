        Find the maxima and the minima of this function. (For the
        polynomial, you can guess and factor off some small integer
        solutions. You can also ask a computer for the roots.) (6) 
        <me>
          f(x) = \frac{x^3 - 2}{x^2 + 1}

        Which point(s) on the parabola <m>(y-4) = (x-2)^2</m> are
        closest to the the point <m>(2,10)</m>? (6)

        Consider the following cost and benefit functions. (8)

          <mrow>
            C(x) \amp = 15x^3 - 105x^2 + 225x 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            B(x) \amp = 75 x 
          </mrow>

          At what production level is there maximum net benefit?
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          At what production level is there maximum gross benefit while
          still having cost not exceed benefit? (You can guess small
          integer roots of the cubic or have a computer find the roots
          for you).

      Find the maxima and the minima (if any) of this function. (6)
      <me>
        f(x) = \frac{2x + 4}{x^2 + 4x + 1}
      </me>

      Find the maxima and the minima of this function. (6)
      <me>
        f(x) = \ln (x^2 + 7)

      <p>
        Consider the following cost and benefit functions. (8)
        <md>
          <mrow>
            C(x) \amp = x^3 - 6x^2 + 4x + 3 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            B(x) \amp = 5x 
          </mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p><ol>
        <li>
          At what production level is there maximum net benefit?
        </li>
        <li>
          At what production level is there maximum gross benefit while
          still having cost not exceed benefit? 
        </li>
        <li>
          What are the potential problems with these cost and benefit
          functions? Why might they be unrealistic?
        </li>
      </ol></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        If <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are continuous on <m>\RR</m> and have
        the same asymptotic order, what similarities (if any) do
        <m>f</m> amd <m>g</m> have in their extrema? Use some
        examples, but give a general answers as well. (4)

      Find the maxima and the minima of this function. (6)

        Consider the following cost and benefit functions. (8)
        <md>
          <mrow>
            C(x) \amp = \frac{1}{3} (3x^3 + 20x^2 - 118 x + 101)
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            B(x) \amp = \frac{5x}{3} + \frac{1}{3} 
          </mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p><ol>
        <li>
          At what production level is there maximum net benefit?
        </li>
        <li>
          At what production level is there maximum gross benefit while
          still having cost not exceed benefit? 
        </li>
        <li>
          What are the potential problems with these cost and benefit
          functions? Why might they be unrealistic?
        </li>

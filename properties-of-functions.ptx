      Calculus studies the behaviour of functions. Many behaviours are
      described by defining various properties. Many of the properties
      defined here may be review from your mathematical experience,
      though the terms may have changed.
    </p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>
        The <em>domain</em> of a function is all possible (real
        number) inputs to the function. The domain can be restricted
        to a smaller subset if desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <em>range</em> of a function is all possible (real number)
        outputs of the function.
      </li>
      <li>
        A function is <em>even</em> if <m>f(-x) = f(x)</m>.
        Visually, the graph of the function has a mirror-image
        symmetry over the <m>y</m> axis.
      </li>
      <li>
        A function is <em>odd</em> if <m>f(-x) = -f(x)</m>.
        Visually, the graph of the function is the preserved under a
        half-turn rotation about the origin.
      </li>
      <li>
        A function is <em>periodic</em> if there is a real number
        <m>a</m> such that <m>f(x+a) = f(a)</m> for all <m>x</m>.
        The smallest positive real number <m>a</m> that satisfies is
        called the period.
      </li>
      <li>
        A function is called <em>increasing</em> if <m>a \lt b</m>
        implies <m>f(a) \leq f(b)</m>. Visually, the graph of the
        function is growing upwards as the input increases.
      </li>
      <li>
        A function is called <em>decreasing</em> if <m>a \lt b</m>
        implies <m>f(a) \geq f(b)</m>. Visually, the graph of the
        function is declining downwards as the input increases.
      </li>
      <li>
        A function is called <em>monotonic</em> if it is either always
        increasing or always decreasing.
      </li>
      <li>
        A function is <em>bounded above</em> if there is a number
        <m>A</m> such that <m>f(x) \lt A</m> for all <m>x</m>.
        Visually, the graph of the function never gets above the
        height <m>y=A</m>.
      </li>
      <li>
        A function is <em>bounded below</em> if there is a number
        <m>B</m> such that <m>f(x) > B</m> for all <m>x</m>.
        Visually, the graph of the function never gets below the
        height <m>y=B</m>.
      </li>
      <li>
        A function is <em>bounded</em> if it is both bounded above
        and below. That is, there exists numbers <m>A</m> and
        <m>B</m> such that <m>B \lt f(x) \lt A</m> for all <m>x</m>.
        Visually, the function remains within the range <m>y \in
        [A,B]</m> for any input.
      </li>
      <li>
        A <em><m>y</m>-intercept</em> of a function is a place where
        it crosses the <m>y</m> axis. Since a function satisfies a
        vertical line test, there is only one possible <m>y</m>
        intercept found at <m>f(0)</m> (if <m>0</m> is in the domain).
      </li>
      <li>
        An <em><m>x</m>-intercept</em> or <em>root</em> of a
        function is a place where it crosses the <m>x</m> axis or,
        equivalently, has the output <m>f(x) = 0</m>.
      </li>
    </ul></p>

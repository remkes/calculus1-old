    <title>Percentage Growth</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="section-population-growth" />, I talked about
      percetage growth of population. Then, in <xref
      ref="section-differential-equations" />, I argued that we could
      translate percentage growth into a differential equation. If a
      population <m>p(t)</m> had a growth rate of <m>c</m>
      percent, that was equivalent to the equation
      <me>
        \frac{dp}{dt} = \frac{c}{100} p(t) 
      </me>.
      I don't need to state this as percentage. If <m>\alpha</m> is
      the fraction of the population that is added or subtracted in
      one unit of time, the equation is 
      <me>
        \frac{dp}{dt} = \alpha p(t) 
      </me>.
      In the history of population models, this is often called the
      Malthusian model of population growth. It is one of the very
      first pieces of mathematical biology. In Malthus' model, the
      constant <m>\alpha</m> had two (or three pieces). There is a
      positive birth rate <m>b</m>, a negative death rate <m>d</m>,
      and possibly a migration rate <m>m</m> which could be positive
      or negative. The total growth rate is 
      <me>
        \alpha = b - d + m 
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We argued, simply from regression, that the solution to the
      Malthusian model should be exponential. Now I'd like to prove
      that. The Mathusian model is a seperable equation, so we can
      solve is using the techniques of the previous section.
      <me>
        \frac{dp}{dt} = \alpha p(t) 
      </me>
      In the notation of the previous section, <m>f(t) = \alpha</m> and
      <m>g(p) = p</m>. After seperateion, the integral become
      <me>
        \int \frac{1}{p} dp = \int \alpha dt 
      </me>
      Then I can integrate each side. The integral of
      <m>\frac{1}{p}</m> is <m>\ln |p|</m>. Howwever, since we can
      assume the population function must be positive, we can drop the
      absolute value for an integral of <m>\ln |p|</m>. The integral
      of a constant on the right (in the variable <m>t</m> indicated
      by the <m>dt</m>) is <m>\alpha t</m>. I need a constant of
      integration, which I will call <m>c</m>. 
      <me>
       \ln p  = \alpha t + c 
      </me>
      Then I solve for <m>p</m>
      <me>
       p(t) = e^{\alpha t + c} = e^c e^{\alpha t} 
      </me>
      If <m>t = 0</m>, this is <m>p(0) = e^c e^0 = e^c</m>, so
      <m>e^c</m> is the starting population. I'll write this just as
      <m>e^c = p_0</m>. The solution to the percentege growth equation
      (or the Malthusian model) is an exponential function.
      <me>
       p(t) = p_0 e^{\alpha t} 
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Being able to actually solve the DE justifies the previous
      connection we made between exponential functions and percentage
      growth. This is the idea situation: we want to observe a growth
      pattern, write it down in a differential equation, and actually
      solve that differential equation to get a function that
      describese the growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Malthusian model is the starting point for population
      dymanics. A population with ample resources, space to growth,
      and no other limiting factors (such as predators, disease,
      disasters, etc.) will show percentage growth (since natural
      processes like birth and death rates are fractions of the
      totals). However, this is just the starting point. Most
      population don't have ample resources, space to growth, and
      freedom from other limiting factors. In <xref
      ref="section-long-term-behaviour-of-models" />, I already
      introduced the first adjustment to population dynamics: logistic
      growth. 
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsection-logistic-growth">
    <title>Logistic Growth</title>
    <p>
      Logistic growth starts like exponential growth, but slows down
      as the population approachs a certain value, <m>K</m>, called
      the carrying capacity. This measure the effect of a population
      running out of excess room or resources. Essentially, the
      population fills its environment, or at least its niche in that
      environemnt, and levels off to a steady and consistent value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of adjusting the function, I want to adjust the
      Malthusian differential equation to model this carrying
      capacity. The basic model is 
      <me>
        \frac{dp}{dt} = \alpha p
      </me>.
      Now I want the rate of change to start out like this, but
      decrease as I get close to the carrying capacity. It we are
      exactly at the carrying capacity, I want the growth rate to be
      zero. I can accomplish this by multiplying the right side by
      <m>\left( 1 - \frac{p}{K} \right)</m>. When the population
      is small (at least compared to <m>K</m>), this is almost
      <m>1</m>, so multiplication by this term has little effect. When
      the population is close to <m>K</m>, the fraction
      <m>\frac{p}{K}</m> is close to <m>1</m>, so the term becomes
      close to <m>0</m>.  Multiplying by something close to zero makes
      the growth rate shrink to a small value. This is precisely what
      we want: as the population approaches <m>K</m>, the growth rate
      gets smaller and smaller. Finally, if we start above <m>K</m>,
      this term is negative and makes the population decrease back
      down to this value, <m>K</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It we multiply by this term, we get the logistic equaiton.
      <me>
        \frac{dp}{dt} = \alpha p \left( 1 - \frac{p}{K} \right)
      </me>
      I can solve this as a seperable equation as well. I take <m>f(t)
      = \alpha</m> and <m>g(p) = p \left( 1 - \frac{p}{K}
      \right)</m> and use the seperable technique from the previous
      section.
      <me>
        \int \frac{1}{p \left( 1 - \frac{p}{K} \right)} dp = \int
        \alpha dt 
      </me>
      I can simplify the nested fraction on the left by multiplying by
      <m>K</m>.
      <me>
        \int \frac{K}{p(K-p)} dp = \int \alpha dt 
      </me>
      Unfortunately, the left integral uses a technique that we won't
      cover in this course (it is covered in Calculus II). Using a
      technique called partial fracitons, the left side can be split
      up this way.
      <me>
        \frac{K}{p(K-p)} = \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{K-p}
      </me>
      Using linearity, this turns the left side integral into two
      integrals.
      <me>
        \int \frac{1}{p} dp + \int \frac{1}{K-p} dp  = \int \alpha dt 
      </me>
      Now we can do both of these integrals. The second integral on
      the left uses a substitution <m>u = K-p</m>, for which I won't
      show the steps here.
      <me>
       \ln p - \ln (K-p) = \alpha t + c 
      </me>
      Then I want to try to solve for <m>p</m>. I can first use a
      property of the logarithm. 
      <me>
       \ln \frac{p}{K-p} = \alpha t + c 
      </me>
      Then I can apply the exponential to both sides.
      <me>
       \frac{p}{K-p} = e^{\alpha t + c} = e^c e^{\alpha t} 
      </me>
      I'll write <m>e^c = b</m>, simply to have an easier way to deal
      with this constant. 
      <me>
       \frac{p}{K-p} = be^{\alpha t} 
      </me>
      I'll then take reciprocals of both sides.
      <me>
       \frac{K-p}{p} = \frac{1}{be^{\alpha t}}
      </me>
      This lets me simplify the left side.
      <me>
       \frac{K}{p} - 1 = \frac{1}{be^{\alpha t}}
      </me>
      Then there is only one <m>p</m> term, which I can isolate. 
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \frac{K}{p} = \frac{1}{be^{\alpha t}} + 1 = \frac{be^{\alpha
          t} + 1}{be^{\alpha t}}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \frac{p}{K} = \frac{b e^{\alpha t}}{be^{\alpha t} +1}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          p = \frac{Kbe^{\alpha t}}{be^{\alpha t} +1}
        </mrow>
      </md>
      This is the logistic growth function. However, this is not
      precisely the form that I gave for it in <xref
      ref="section-long-term-behaviour-of-models" />. The reason the
      forms differ is that this constant <m>b</m> is not the starting
      population. If I use an initial condition <m>p(0) = p_0</m> in
      the solution, I get this expression.
      <me>
        p_0 = \frac{Kbe^{0}}{be^{0} +1} = \frac{Kb}{b+1} 
      </me>
      Skipping the algebra steps, I solve for <m>b</m>.
      <me>
        b = \frac{p_0}{K-p_0}
      </me>
      I can put this into the expression.
      <me>
        p(t) = \frac{K\left( \frac{p_0}{K-p_0} \right) e^{\alpha
        t}}{ \left( \frac{p_0}{K - p_0} \right) e^{\alpha t} +1}
      </me>
      Finally, I simplity by multiplying numerator and denominator by
      <m>(K-p_0)</m>
      <me>
        p(t) = \frac{Kp_0e^{\alpha t}}{ p_0e^{\alpha t} + K - p_0}
        = \frac{Kp_0e^{\alpha t}}{ p_0(e^{\alpha t}- 1) + K}
      </me>
      Now I have indeed reconstructed logistic growth as it was first
      introduced in <xref ref="section-long-term-behaviour-of-models"
      />. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In summary, I was able to turn the two most important
      basic models of population into differential equations. Using
      the method of seperable equations, I was able to actually solve
      the DEs and produce the function which I claim were the solution
      many weeks ago. I have justification for those functions, since
      I have now produced them from the DE instead of pulling them out
      of thin air.

  <title>Rules for Differentiation</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Now that we have the definition and an idea of its meaning, we
      move on to several lectures on the technical details of
      calculating derivatives.

    <title>Important Derivatives</title>
    <p>
      We'll start with a number of standard derivatives. If a
      function is constant, its rate of change is zero, so its must
      have a zero derivative.
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dx} c = 0
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      For the function <m>f(x) = mx + b</m>, the graph is a straight
      line with slope <m>m</m>. Since the derivative measures the
      slope, it should be constant <m>m</m>.
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dx} mx + b = m
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We have two standard derivatives we start with for trigonometry.
      There are given here without proof.

        \frac{d}{dx} \sin x \amp = \cos x \amp \frac{d}{dx} \cos
        x \amp = -\sin x
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We also have a standard derivative for the exponential function,
      established using the definition of the derivative.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \frac{d}{dx} a^x \amp = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0}
          \frac{a^{x+h} - a^x}{h} = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{a^x
          a^h - a^x}{h}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} a^x \frac{a^h-1}{h} = a^x
          \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{a^h-1}{h} = a^x \left( \left.
          \frac{d}{dx} a^x \right|_{x=0} \right)
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the last step, we changed the limit into a derivative using
      the definition of the derivative at the specific point
      <m>x=0</m>. The vertical line means <q>evaluated at
      <m>x=0</m></q>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This formula shows that derivative of <m>a^x</m> is formed by
      multiply by the derivative at <m>x=0</m>. Note that all
      exponentials go through the point <m>(0,1)</m>. <xref
      ref="figure-four-exponential-functions" /> shows the
      the graphs of several exponential function (for bases <m>a >
      1</m>).

          real f3(real x) {return 4^x;}

          draw(graph(f1,-3,1));
          draw(graph(f2,-3,1));

    <p>
      The slope at <m>(0,1)</m> determines the derivative. As seen in
      the <xref ref="figure-four-exponential-functions" />,
      for different choices of the base, we get different slopes going
      through the point <m>(0,1)</m>. There is one special base which
      has slope <m>1</m> at the point <m>(0,1)</m>. By definition,
      that base is the number <m>e</m>. (This number was defined
      earlier by a limit and we in Calculus II that the two
      definitions coincide.) By definition, the function <m>e^x</m>
      satisfies an important property.
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the main reason that we are so fond of <m>e</m> as an
      expoenntial base. <m>e^x</m> is the nicest function to
      differentiate, since it doesn't change at all.

    <title>Power Rule</title>
    <p>
      So far, we've looked at specific derivatives and used the
      definition to work them out. This approach quickly becomes
      intenable due to complications in the limit calculation.
      Therefore, we'd like to find some general rules that allow us to
      calculate derivatives without using the definition. The first
      rules is called the power rules.
      Let <m>n \in \RR</m> with <m>n=0</m>.
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dx} x^n = nx^{n-1}

      We can give a proof when <m>n</m> is a positive integer, using
      the binomial theorem.

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-derivatives-linearity">
    <title>Linearity</title>
    <p>
      The next rules is a set of three rules which are called
      linearity. (Linearity shows that derivatives addition,
      subtraction and multiplication by constants. In general, any
      operation in mathematics that cooperates with those these
      actions is called a linear property). If <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>
      are differentiable functions and <m>c</m> is a real constant,
      then three rules hold.

      The proof of the linearity rules is excluded here, though it is
      relatively easy to construct using the linearity of the limit
      and the definition of the derivative. Using linearity and the
      power rule, we can take the derivative of any polynomial.

    <title>Leibniz Rule</title>
    <p>
      Limits worked well with all four arithmetic operations:
      addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. We might
      hope the same is true for derivatives, but we would be
      disappointed. There are rules for multiplication and division,
      but they are more complicated that what we had for limits. The
      rule for products is called the product rules or the Leibniz
      rule. Let <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> be differentiable functions.
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dx} fg = g \frac{df}{dx} + f \frac{dg}{dx}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Leibniz rule is, in many ways, the archetypical rule that
      identifies differentiation. There are many derivative-like
      operations in mathematics and they all conform to some version
      of the Leibniz rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following calculation is a proof for the Leibniz rule. Note
      in the second step, we've added and subtracted the same term in
      the numerator.

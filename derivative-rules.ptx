  <title>Rules for Differentiation</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      I have introduced the idea of a derivative in <xref
      ref="section-population-growth" /> and a formal limit definition
      in <xref ref="section-derivative-definition" />. However, I
      don't yet have good tools to actually calculate derivatives. This
      section introduces tools for calculating derivatives.

    <title>Important Derivatives</title>
    <p>
      I'll start with a number of standard derivatives. If a
      function is constant, its rate of change is zero, so its must
      have a zero derivative.
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dx} c = 0
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      For the linear function <m>f(x) = mx + b</m>, the graph is a
      straight line with slope <m>m</m>. Since the derivative measures
      the slope, it should be constant <m>m</m>.
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dx} mx + b = m
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are the derivatives of sine and cosine. They are given
      here without proof.
      <md>
        <mrow>
        \frac{d}{dx} \sin x \amp = \cos x \amp \frac{d}{dx} \cos
        x \amp = -\sin x
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I want to calculate the derivative of an exponential
      function with exponential base.  <m>a</m>. I start with the
      second version of the definition of the derivative and do some
      algebra with the limit. 
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \frac{d}{dx} a^x \amp = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0}
          \frac{a^{x+h} - a^x}{h} = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{a^x
          a^h - a^x}{h}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} a^x \frac{a^h-1}{h} = a^x
          \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{a^h-1}{h} = a^x \left( \left.
          \frac{d}{dx} a^x \right|_{x=0} \right)
        </mrow>
      </md>
      In the last step, I changed the limit into a derivative using
      the definition of the derivative at the specific point
      <m>x=0</m>. The vertical line means <q>evaluated at
      <m>x=0</m></q>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This formula shows that derivative of <m>a^x</m> is a product of
      the same function <m>a^x</m> multiplied by its derivative at
      <m>x=0</m>. Note that all exponentials go through the point
      <m>(0,1)</m>. <xref ref="figure-four-exponential-functions" />
      shows the the graphs of several exponential function (for bases
      <m>a > 1</m>).

    <p>
      The slope at <m>(0,1)</m> determines the derivative. As seen in
      <xref ref="figure-four-exponential-functions" />,
      for different choices of the base, there are different slopes of
      the graph when it passes
      through the point <m>(0,1)</m>. There is one special base which
      has slope <m>1</m> at the point <m>(0,1)</m>. By definition,
      that base is the number <m>e</m>. (This number was defined
      earlier by a limit; in Calculus II I will argue that the two
      definitions coincide.) By definition, the function <m>e^x</m>
      satisfies an important property.
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the main reason that we are so fond of <m>e</m> as an
      expoenntial base. <m>e^x</m> is the nicest function to
      differentiate, since it doesn't change at all. Again, this is a
      <emph>definition</emph> of the number <m>e</m>; it is
      specifically chosen for this special property.

    <title>Power Rule</title>
    <p>
      So far, I've looked at specific derivatives and used the
      definition to work them out. This approach quickly becomes
      unreasonable due to complications in the limit calculations.
      Therefore, I'll present some general rules that allow me to
      calculate derivatives without using the definition. The first
      rule is called the <term>power rule</term>. Let <m>n \in \RR</m>
      with <m>n \neq 0</m>.
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dx} x^n = nx^{n-1}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      I can give a proof when <m>n</m> is a positive integer, using
      the binomial theorem. (The power rule applies for all real
      exponents, but the general proof is less accessible.)

      I've expended the binomial in the numerator by the binomial
      theorem. After doing this, the first term of the expansion will
      always cancel with the last term in the numerator. The resulting
      terms all have <m>h</m> in them, so I can factor that <m>h</m>
      out, cancel it off, and then evaluate the limit.

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-derivatives-linearity">
    <title>Linearity</title>
    <p>
      Next is a set of three rules which are collectively called
      <term>linearity</term>.  Linearity shows that derivatives work
      nicely with addition, subtraction and multiplication by
      constants. In general, any operation in mathematics that
      cooperates with those these actions is called a linear
      operation.  If <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are differentiable
      functions and <m>c</m> is a real constant, then these three
      rules hold.

      The proof of the linearity rules is excluded here, though it is
      relatively easy to construct using the linearity of the limit
      and the definition of the derivative. Using linearity and the
      power rule, I can take the derivative of any polynomial.

          Here are some example polynomial derivatives. For each
          polynomial, I split up the derivative over the additions and
          subtractions using linearity. Then I pull out the constants
          using linearity. What is left is a power rule calculation
          for each power in the polynomial.

    <title>Leibniz Rule</title>
    <p>
      Limits worked well with all four arithmetic operations:
      addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. I might
      hope the same is true for derivatives, but I would be
      disappointed. There are rules for multiplication and division,
      but they are more complicated than the rules for limits. The
      rule for products is called the <term>product rule</term> or the
      <term>Leibniz rule</term>.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> be differentiable functions.
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} fg = g \frac{df}{dx} + f \frac{dg}{dx}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The following calculation is a proof for the Leibniz rule. I
          start with the limit definition of the derivative, using the
          version with <m>h \rightarrow 0</m>.
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dx} fg = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0}
            \frac{f(x+h)g(x+h) - f(x)g(x)}{h}
          </me>
          Then I'm going to use a strange but surprisingly common
          algebraic trick. I want to do some particular kind of
          factoring in the numerator. To make that work, I add and
          subtract the same term from the numerator. Adding and
          subtracting the same thing doesn't change the expression, so
          equality is preserved. 
          <me>
            = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h)g(x+h) - f(x+h)
            g(x) + f(x+h) g(x) - f(x)g(x)}{h}
          </me>
          Then I'm going to write the first two terms as one limit and
          the next two terms as another limit. In the first two terms,
          <m>f(x+h)</m> is a common factor, so I can pull it out of
          the fraction. In the second two terms, <m>g(x)</m> is a
          common factor, so I can likewise pull it out of the
          fraction.
          <me>
            = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} f(x+h)\frac{g(x+h) - g(x)}{h} +
            \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} g(x) \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
          </me>
          I can use the limit rules for the first limit. The limit of
          <m>f(x+h)</m> as <m>h \rightarrow 0</m> is just <m>f(x)</m>,
          so I'll evaluate that piece of the product and leave the
          remaining limit. In the second limit, <m>g(x)</m> doesn't
          involve the variable <m>h</m> at all, so it can simply be
          pulled out of the limitl.
          <me>
            = f(x) \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{g(x+h) - g(x)}{h} +
            g(x) \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
          </me>
          Finally, I can simplify identify these two limits as the
          definitions of the derivatives of <m>g(x)</m> and
          <m>f(x)</m>, respectively. 
          <me>
            = f(x) \frac{dg}{dx} + f(x) \frac{df}{dx}

    </proposition>

      The Leibniz rule is, in many ways, the archetypical rule that
      identifies differentiation. There are many derivative-like
      operations in mathematics and they all conform to some version

      Like the Leibniz rule for products, there is a complicated rule
      for derivatives of quotients, called the <term>quotient

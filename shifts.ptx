    <p>
      For conics, I noted that all of the conic equations were
      centered at the origin. By understanding shifts of loci, we
      learn how to write conics centered at any point. Shifts are a
      process of changing the equation of a locus to move the locus
      around the plane. There are a great examples of the connection
      between algebra and geometry: we make an algebraic change to the
      equation and give a geometric interpretation of that chage. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll describe these algebraic changes and their geometric
      implications. Let <m>a</m> be a positive real number.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If we replace all instance of <m>x</m> by <m>x-a</m> in
            the equation of a locus, we move the locus <m>a</m> units
            in the positive <m>x</m> direction.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If we replace all instance of <m>x</m> by <m>x+a</m> in
            the equation of a locus, we move the locus <m>a</m> units
            in the negative <m>x</m> direction.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If we replace all instance of <m>y</m> by <m>y-a</m> in
            the equation of a locus, we move the locus <m>a</m> units
            in the positive <m>y</m> direction.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If we replace all instance of <m>y</m> by <m>y+a</m> in
            the equation of a locus, we move the locus <m>a</m> units
            in the negative <m>y</m> direction.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Notice that all these shifts are counter-intuitive. Replacing
      with a negative produces a positive shift, and vice-versa.

      Recall the cirlce of radius one is the locus of the equation
      <m>x^2 + y^2 = 1</m>.  <xref
      ref="figure-shifts-circle">Figure</xref> shows four different
      shifts of the unit circle. You can see the counter-intuitive
      shifts in the new centre points of the circles. 
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The locus <m>(x-1)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 1</m> is a circle of
            radius 1 centered at <m>(1,2)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The locus <m>(x+3)^2 + (y-3)^2 = 1</m> is a circle of
            radius 1 centered at <m>(-3,3)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The locus <m>(x+4)^2 + (y+6)^2 = 1</m> is a circle of
            radius 1 centered at <m>(-4,-6)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The locus <m>(x-5)^2 + (y+2)^2 = 1</m> is a circle of
            radius 1 centered at <m>(5,-2)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

          The rate of change of a function is proportional to the
          square root of the function.
        </li>
        <li>
          The rate of change of a function is proportional to 
          a constant plus the function squared. 
        </li>
        <li>
          The rate of change of a function is a negative constant.

      Draw a phase line for this differential equation and label the
      trajectories. You may assume this is a population model and <m>
      p \geq 0</m>. (5) 
      <me>
        \frac{dp}{dt} = (4-p)(9-p)

      When modelling a population, why is it often easier to start
      with a differential equation than directly imposing a function?

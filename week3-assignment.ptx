          The rate of change of a function is proportional to the
          cosine of the function. 
        </li>
        <li>
          The rate of change of a function is proportional to 
          the reciprocal of the logarithm of the function.

      Draw a phase line for this differential equation and label the
      trajectories. You may assume this is a population model and <m>

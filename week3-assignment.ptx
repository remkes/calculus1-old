        <li>
          The rate of change of a function if proportional to the
          difference between the function and a positive constant. 
          
        </li>
        <li>
          The rate of change of a function is proportional to 
          the function cubed. 
        </li>
        <li>
          The rate of change of a function is a degree three
          polynomial in the function.

      Draw a phase line for this differential equation and label the
      trajectories. You may assume this is a population model and <m>

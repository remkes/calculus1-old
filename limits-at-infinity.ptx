    <p>
      In addition to asking what happens to a function as the input
      approaches paticular finite values, we can also ask what happens
      as the input approaches infinity, that is, at the input gets
      larger and larger.

    <p>
      The statement
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} f(x) = L
      </me>
      means that as <m>x</m> gets larger and larger without bound,
      <m>f(x)</m> gets closer and closer to <m>L</m>. The statement
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} f(x) = \infty
      </me>
      means that as <m>x</m> gets larger and larger without bound,
      <m>f(x)</m> also gets larger and larger without bound. The
      statement
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} f(x) = -\infty
      </me>
      means that as <m>x</m> gets larger and larger without bound,
      <m>f(x)</m> becomes a larger and larger negative number without
      bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      These statements are defined the same way for <m>x \rightarrow
      -\infty</m> when <m>x</m> becomes a larger and larger negative
      number without bound.

    <p>
      If we have a function <m>f(x)</m> where the limit
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow \pm \infty} f(x) = L
      </me>
      exists either at positive or negative infinity, that means that
      the graph of the function approaches the line <m>y=L</m>. Such
      lines are called <em>horizontal asymptotes</em>.

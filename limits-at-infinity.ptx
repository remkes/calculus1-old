    <p>
      In addition to asking what happens to a function as the input
      approaches paticular finite values, I can also ask what happens
      as the input <sq>approaches infinityi</sq>, that is, as the
      input gets larger and larger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The statement
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} f(x) = L
      </me>
      means that as <m>x</m> gets larger and larger without bound,
      <m>f(x)</m> gets closer and closer to <m>L</m>. The statement
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} f(x) = \infty
      </me>
      means that as <m>x</m> gets larger and larger without bound,
      <m>f(x)</m> also gets larger and larger without bound. The
      statement
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} f(x) = -\infty
      </me>
      means that as <m>x</m> gets larger and larger without bound,
      <m>f(x)</m> becomes a larger and larger negative number without
      bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      These statements are defined the same way for <m>x \rightarrow
      -\infty</m> when the input <m>x</m> becomes a larger and larger
      negative number without bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all of these definitions, the symbol <m>\infty</m> means
      <sq>getting larger and larger without bound</sq>. It is never a
      number, never a quantity. It is a convenient shorthand for the
      idea of unbounded growth. Please keep this in mind, particularly
      for your algebra and arithmetic. Inifnity is not a number and
      doing algebra or arithmetic with it doesn't make sense.

    <title>Horizontal Asymptotes</title>
    <p>
      When a function <m>f(x)</m> has a finite limit as the input
      growths with out bound:
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} f(x) = L
      </me>,
      then the graph of the function approaches the line <m>y=L</m>.
      Such
      lines are called <em>horizontal asymptotes</em>. Similarly, if
      the limit is
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow -\infty} f(x) = L
      </me>,
      then again the fuction approach the line <m>y=L</m> and
      such a line is also called a horizontal asymptote. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To search for horizontal asymptotes, I consider limits of a
      function as <m>x \rightarrow \pm \infty</m>. If such a limit
      produces a finite result (the number <m>L</m> above), then the
      line <m>y=L</m> is a horizontal asymptote. Note that there are
      two possibilities for horizontal asymptotes: in the positive and
      in the negative directions. It is possible for a function to
      have a horizontal asymptote in only one direction, or in both
      directions but at different values.

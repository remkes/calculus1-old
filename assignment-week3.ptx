        Translate the following sentences into differential equations. 
        <ol>
          <li>
            The rate of change of a function is proportional to the
            square root of the function. 
          </li>
          <li>  
            The rate of change of a function is proportional to the
            reciprocal of the function plus a constant.
          </li>
          <li>
            The rate of change of a function is proportional to the
            difference between the function squares and the function
            cubed.

        Draw phase lines and trajectories for these autonomous
        differential equations. (Show the steps in your work: finding
        the stead states, finding the trajectories, constructing the
        phase line and labelling it. You may assume these are all
        population models, so <m>p \geq 0</m>.)

              \frac{dp}{dt} = p^2 - 12p + 35

              \frac{dp}{dt} = (p-2)^2(p-4)^3(p-6)

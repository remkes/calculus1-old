      Calculate the following integrals. Clearly label your
      substitutions. (For the third integral, use a trig identity 
      to change <m>\cos^2 u</m> into a function which is easier to
      integrate). (16)

          \int (12 x^2 + 6x)(e^{4x^3 + 3x^2}) dx

          \int \frac{6x}{10x - 4} dx 
        </me></li>

          \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}} \frac{\cos^2 (\tan x)}{\cos^2 x} dx 
        </me></li>

          \int \frac{6x + 12}{x^2 +4x} dx

        Consider this integral
        <me>
          \int \sqrt{ 1 - e^{-x}} dx 
        </me>
        The function is a composition, so I would use the substitution
        rule.  I could choose an outisde function of <m>f(u) =
        \sqrt{u}</m> (with <m>u = 1 - e^{-x}</m>) or <m>f(u) =
        \sqrt{1-u}</m>.  Which choice is better for calculating the
        integral? Which choice would you make and why? (4)

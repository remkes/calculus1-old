    <title>An Economic Model</title>
    <p>
      A nice use of optimization happens in economics and finance
      through a technique called marginal analysis. Naively, marginal
      analysis is frequently presented as a sales and production
      question: <m>C(x)</m> is the cost of producing <m>x</m> units of
      a product and <m>B(x)</m> is the revenue from selling <m>x</m>
      units of a product. I'll take a slightly more general
      interpretation, where we measure cost <m>C(x)</m> and benefit
      <m>B(x)</m> without specifying exactly what form those costs and
      benefits can take. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In this context, the derivative <m>C^\prime(x)</m> is called the
      <em>marginal cost</em> and the derivative <m>B^\prime(x)</m> is
      called the <em>marginal benefit</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can ask three questions.
      <ul>
        <li>
          First, when is there a maximum net benefit?  That is, when
          is the difference <m>B(x) - C(x)</m> maximized?  The
          derivative must be zero, so <m>B^\prime(x) - C^\prime(x) =
          0</m>, which is <m>B^\prime(x) = C^\prime(x)</m>. I
          optimize net benefit when the marginal costs are equal.
          After finding such a point, I will still have to
          investigate to see if the point is a minimum, maximum or
          neither.
        </li>
        <li>
          The second question is a local variant of the first
          question. If production rate is currently at some level 
          <m>x_0</m> units, would more production increase the net
          benefit?  That is, is the net benefit currently an
          increasing function?  Increasing means positive
          derivative, so I look for <m>B^\prime(x) - C^\prime(x) >
          0</m>, which is <m>B^\prime(x) > C^\prime(x)</m>.
          Increasing production increases the net benefit if the
          marginal benefit is larger than the marginal cost. This
          leads to a reasonable interpretation of these derivatives:
          marginal cost is (roughly) the cost to produce <em>the
          next</em> unit, and marginal benefit is the benefit due to
          <em>the next</em> unit. I can increase net benefit if
          the next unit has greater benefit than cost. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Lastly, I can ask a different strategic question.
          Instead of maximizing net benefit (like profit for a
          company), what if the motivation is just maximum benefit
          while still breaking even (more like a non-profit). This
          is still an optimization question, but with a different
          approach. Now I want to break even, which mathematically
          is <m>B(x) = C(x)</m>. The derivatives no longer come
          into play; I just have to solve this equality of
          functions and find the solution <m>x</m> with the highest
          gross benefit.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      This certainly isn't an exhaustive list of all possible
      questions; strategically, there could be many considerations
      leading to many questions. Perhaps there is a fixed budget, so
      the cost <m>C(x)</m> cannot, under any circumstances, cross a
      fixed maximum. If our product is a service, the goal might be
      maximum usage instead of maximum net benefit. Perhaps I need
      to minimize average cost of production instead of net benefit.
      Whenever I use mathematics for strategic reasons in a applied
      situation, it is important to remember that the mathematics only
      answers the questions I asked. It doesn't tell me which
      question I actually want to ask, nor how to compare between the
      various questions.

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Take the cost function <m>C(x) = x^3 - x^2 + x+ 1</m> and
          the benefit function <m>B(x) = 3x</m>. Assume that this
          model measures the produce of some objects that are then
          sold. <m>x</m> can be measured in thousdands of units and
          <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> can be measured in millions of
          dollars. Notice that <m>C(0) = 1</m>, which could represent
          an initial start-up cost before the production of a single
          unit.
        </p>
        <p>
          I calculate the derivatives: <m>C^\prime(x) = 3x^2
          -2x+1</m> and <m>B^\prime(x) = 3</m>. These are equal when
          <m>x = \frac{1}{3} (1 \pm \sqrt{7})</m>. Discarding the
          negative, the other root is approximately <m>1.215</m>, so a
          production of 1215 units gives the maximum net benefit.
          Below that point, marginal benefit exceeds cost, so I
          should increase production. Above that point, marginal cost
          will exceed benefit, so I should decrease production.
        </p>
        <p>
          The break even points are found by solving the cubic: <m>x^3
          -x^2-2x+1 - 3x = 0</m>. The cubic doesn't factor nicely,
          but a computer can give the approximate even <m>x</m>
          values: <m>-1.25</m>, <m>0.45</m> and <m>1.81</m>. I
          discard the negative value again. The largest break-even
          point is at approximately <m>1.81</m>. All these values and
          the behaviour of the cost and benefit functions are shown in
          <xref ref="figure-marginal-analysis" />.

    <title>An Economic Model</title>
    <p>
      A nice use of optimization happens in economic and finance
      through a technique called marginal analysis. Naively, marginal
      analysis is frequently presented as a sales and production
      question: <m>C(x)</m> is the cost of producing <m>x</m> units of
      a product and <m>B(x)</m> is the revenue from selling <m>x</m>
      units of a product. I'll take a slightly more general
      interpretation, where we measure cost <m>C(x)</m> and benefit
      <m>B(x)</m> without specifying exactly what form those costs and
      benefits can take. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In this context, the derivative <m>C^\prime(x)</m> is called the
      <em>marginal cost</em> and the derivative <m>B^\prime(x)</m> is
      called the <em>marginal benefit</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can ask three questions.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            First, when do we have maximum net benefit?  That is, when
            is the difference <m>B(x) - C(x)</m> maximized?  The
            derivative must be zero, so <m>B^\prime(x) - C^\prime(x) =
            0</m>, which is <m>B^\prime(x) = C^\prime(x)</m>. We
            optimize net benefit when the marginal costs are equal.
            After finding such a point, we will still have to
            investigate to see if the point is a minimum, maximum or
            neither.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The second question is a local variant of the first
            question. If we are currently at a production rate of
            <m>x_0</m> units, would more production increase the net
            benefit?  That is, is the net benefit currently an
            increasing function?  Increasing means positive
            derivative, so we look for <m>B^\prime(x) - C^\prime(x) >
            0</m>, which is <m>B^\prime(x) > C^\prime(x)</m>.
            Increasing production increases the net benefit if the
            marginal benefit is larger than the marginal cost. This
            leads to a reasonable interpretation of these derivatives:
            marginal cost is (roughly) the cost to produce <em>the
            next</em> unit, and marginal benefit is the benefit due to
            <em>the next</em> unit. We can increase net benefit if
            the next unit has greater benefit than cost. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Lastly, we can ask a different strategic question.
            Instead of maximizing net benefit (like profit for a
            company), what if our motivation is just maximum benefit
            while still breaking even (more like a non-profit). This
            is still an optimization question, but with a different
            approach. Now we want to break even, which mathematically
            is <m>B(x) = C(x)</m>. The derivatives no longer come
            into play; we just have to solve this equality of
            functions and find the solution <m>x</m> with the highest
            gross benefit.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      This certainly isn't an exhaustive list of all possible
      questions; strategically, there could be many considerations
      leading to many questions. Perhaps we have a fixed budget, so
      the cost <m>C(x)</m> cannot, under any circumstances, cross a
      fixed maximum. If our product is a service, our goal might be
      maximum usage instead of maximum net benefit. Perhaps we need
      to minimize average cost of production instead of net benefit.
      Whenever we use mathematics for strategic reasons in a applied
      situation, it is important to remember that the mathematics only
      answers the questions we asked. It doesn't tell us which
      question we actually want to ask, nor how to compare between the
      various questions.

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Take the cost function <m>C(x) = x^3 - x^2 + x+ 1</m> and
          the benefit function <m>B(x) = 3x</m>. Assume that we are
          producing some unit for sale, that <m>x</m> is measured in
          thousdands of units, and that <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> are
          measured in millions of dollars. Notice that <m>C(0) =
          1</m>, which could represent an initial start-up cost before
          the production of a single unit.
        </p>
        <p>
          We calculate the derivatives: <m>C^\prime(x) = 3x^2
          -2x+1</m> and <m>B^\prime(x) = 3</m>. These are equal when
          <m>x = \frac{1}{3} (1 +\pm \sqrt{7})</m>. Discarding the
          negative, the other root is approximately <m>1.215</m>, so a
          production of 1215 units gives the maximum net benefit.
          Below that point, marginal benefit exceeds cost, so we
          should increase production. Above that point, marginal cost
          will exceed benefit, so we should decrease production.
        </p>
        <p>
          The break even points are found by solving the cubic: <m>x^3
          -x^2-2x+1 - 3x = 0</m>. The cubic doesn't factor nicely,
          but a computer can give us the approximate even <m>x</m>
          values: <m>-1.25</m>, <m>0.45</m> and <m>1.81</m>. We
          discard the negative value again. The largest break-even
          point is at approximately <m>1.81</m>.

      The simplest these loci are lines. Lines are given by equations
      <m>ax + by + c = 0</m> for constants <m>a,b,c</m>. If <m>b \neq
      0</m>, then this can be converted into the more familiar
      slope-intercept form <m>y = mx + n</m> by solving for <m>y</m>.
      Along with planes and other flat objects, lines are called the
      <em>linear loci</em>. Linear loci can are loci whose equations
      in <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> (or in more variables in higher
      dimensional <m>\RR^n</m>) involve only degree one polynomials.
      The subject of linear algebra is the study of such linear loci
      and their many properties.

      You will be expected to work with the equations of lines. In
      particular, you will need to be able to derive the equation of
      the line, both in standard form and slope-intercept form, given
      two points or given a point and a slope. This will be
      particularly important when we describe tangent lines to
      graphs.

    <title>Equations of Lines</title>
    <p>
      When I defined loci in <xref ref="section-analytic-geometry"
      />, I mentioned that the first and most common type of
      locus is a line. This section reviews some definitions and
      calculations for lines. This should be familiar material from
      your previous mathematical experience, but it is worth
      reviewing. 
    </p>
    <p>
      A line is the locus of any equation where the variables <m>x</m>
      and <m>y</m> show up multiplied by constants and added together.
      Other than multiplication by a constant, no other operations are
      performed on the variables: no exponents, no roots, no
      functions, nothing else. These equations, since they produce
      lines, are called linear equations. Here are some examples.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          y \amp = 7x - 9 
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          5y + 4x - 10 \amp = 0
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \frac{1}{5} y - \frac{2}{7} x - \frac{5}{17} \amp = 0 
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \sqrt{7}y \amp = \pi x + \frac{1}{\sqrt{19}}
        </mrow>
      </md>
      In all these equations, all I have done is multiplied each
      variable by some constant and added the results together, making
      them equal to some other constant. By adding and subtracting
      terms, I can put some of the variables or the constant on the
      right or left side of the equation, as I see fit. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If I wanted a general form, then I let the symbols <m>a_1</m>,
      <m>a_2</m> and<m>a_3</m> stand for constants. I could bring
      everything over to one side of the equation and write the
      general form of an equation of a line as follows. 
      <me>
        a_1 x + a_2 y + a_3 = 0 
      </me>
      This is a reasonable general form. All lines can be described by
      an equation of this form. However, this is not the most
      intuitive form <mdash /> I get that form by considering slope.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsection-slope">
    <title>Slope</title>
    <p>
      The slope of a straight line is a measure of its steepness. A
      large positive slope descrbes a steep line <mdash /> one that is
      quickly increasing. A small positive slope describes a shallow
      line <mdash /> one that is slowly increasing. A negative slope
      describes a decreasing line.
    </p>
    <p>
      A line with a slope of zero is a horizontal line: it does not
      increase or decrease at all. A vertical line has no slope at
      all. (It does <em>not</em> have an infinite slope <mdash /> the
      slope is simply undefined). 
    </p>
    <p>
      To calculate the slope, I can choose any two points on the
      line. I calculate the difference in the <m>y</m> coordinates
      and call this the <term>rise</term>: it measures the vertical
      distance between the two points. Then I calculate the difference
      in the <m>x</m> coordinates and call this the <term>run</term>:
      it measures the horizontal distance between the two points. The
      slope is the rise divided by the run.
      <me>
        \text{Slope} = \frac{\text{Rise}}{\text{Run}}
      </me>
      An example of a slope calculation is shown in <xref
      ref="figure-slope" />.

    <p>
      The calculation of slope as rise over run shows again why
      veritcal lines have no slope. The <m>x</m> coordinates of any
      two points on a vertical line are the same, to the run would be
      zero. To calculate the slope would involve division by zero,
      which is not defined. Therefore, vertical lines have no slope.
      (Dividing by zero is undefined <mdash /> not infinity.)

    <title>Slope Intercept Form</title>
    <p>
      Now that I have defined slope, I can review or introduce a
      common way of writing the equations of lines. I can return to
      the four example lines I use above; in each of these, I will
      re-arrange the equation so that <m>y</m> is alone on the left
      side.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          y \amp = 7x - 9 
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          y \amp = - \frac{4}{5} x + 2
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          y \amp = \frac{10}{7} x + \frac{25}{17} 
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          y \amp = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{7}} x + \frac{1}{\sqrt{19}\sqrt{7}}
        </mrow>
      </md>
      To get the general form, I solve for <m>y</m> on the left. Let
      <m>m</m> and <m>b</m> be constants (the choice of these letters
      is conventional and used in many places). This process produces
      the well-known slope-intercept form of the equation of a line.
      <me>
        y = mx + b 
      </me>
      In this form, the number <m>m</m> will always be the slope of
      the line. The number <m>b</m> will be the <m>y</m>-coordinate of
      the point where the line crosses the <m>y</m> axis; this is
      called the <term><m>y</m>-intercept</term>. These two pieces of
      information are enough to completely determine the line. If I
      know where a line crosses the <m>y</m>-axis and I know how
      quickly is grows from that point (its slope), then I know
      everything about the line.  <xref ref="figure-slope-intercept"
      /> shows an example to illustrate this slope-intercept form.

      As I said above, a horizontal line has a slope of zero. In
      slope-intercept form this is <m>m = 0</m>, so the equation of the
      line looks like
      <me>
        y = 0x + b = b 
      </me>.
      Horizontal lines have equations <m>y = b</m> for some constant.
      All I need to specify is the <m>y</m> coordinate. <m>y = 4</m>
      is the horizontal line where the <m>y</m>-coordinate is always
      <m>4</m>, and the <m>x</m>-coordinate can be anything
      whatsoever. <xref ref="figure-horizontal-lines" /> shows some
      horizontal lines.

    <p>
      I've said several times that a vertical line has no slope;
      therefore, it cannot be expressed in slope-intercept form.
      However, the previous paragraph gives me a good idea of how to
      understand vertical lines. If a horizontal line is simply
      determined by its <m>y</m> coordinate, a vertical line is
      similarly determined by its <m>x</m> coordinate. Any line of the
      form <m>x = b</m> is a vertical line. <m>x = -3</m> is the
      vertical line of points with <m>x</m>-coordinate <m>-3</m> and
      any <m>y</m> coordinate whatsoever. <xref
      ref="figure-vertical-lines" /> shows some vertical lines.

    <title>Calcluating Equations of Lines</title>
    <p>
      It is use to know how to calculate the equation of a line given
      various pieces of information about this line.
    </p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>
        If I am given the slope and the <m>y</m>-intercept, I just
        put those numbers directly into the slope-intercept form. For
        example, if I was asked for the line with slope
        <m>\frac{-2}{5}</m> and <m>y</m>-intercept <m>3</m>, I would
        simply put those numbers into the form and get the equation of
        the line.
        <me>
          y = \frac{-2}{5} x + 3 
        </me>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sometimes I am given a point and a slope. For example, say
        I was asked for the equation of the line with slope <m>4</m>
        that goes through the point <m>(2,2)</m>. I have the slope, so
        I can put that in place of <m>m</m> in the slope intercept form.
        <me>
          y = 4x + b 
        </me>
        The <m>y</m>-intercept is still unknown. However, if I
        substitute the point, I can solve for <m>b</m>.
        <md>
          <mrow>
            y \amp = 4x + b 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            2 \amp = (4)(2) + b 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            2 \amp = 8 + b 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            -6 \amp = b 
          </mrow>
        </md>
        That gives me a value for the <m>y</m>-intercept, hence the
        equation of the line.
        <me>
          y = 4x - 6 
        </me>
        This process works for any line given a slope and a point: put
        the slope into the slope-intercept form, put the point in for
        the coordinates <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, and solve for the
        intercept. 
      </li>
      <li>
        There is one last way of describing a line: by giving two
        points. There is a unique line passing between any two points
        <mdash /> but how do I get the equation of this line? I
        calculate the slope. Recall that slope is defined as the
        quotient of rise over run. Rise is the difference in the <m>y</m>
        coordinates and run is the difference in the <m>x</m>
        coordinates, so given two points I can calculate the slope.
        I'll show this by example: what is the line through the point
        <m>(3,-5)</m> and <m>(1,1)</m>? First I'll calculate the
        slope.
        <me>
          m = \frac{\text{Rise}}{\text{Run}} = \frac{-5 - 1}{3 - 1} =
          \frac{-6}{2} = -3
        </me>
        The slope is <m>-3</m>. I can write the slope-intercept form
        without a still-unkown intercept.
        <me>
          y = -3x + b 
        </me>
        Then the process is the same as the previous case: I have the
        slope and I have a point (two, in fact). I can substitue a point
        (either point will work) to calculate the intercept.
        <md>
          <mrow>
            y \amp = -3x + b 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            -5 \amp = (-3)(3) + b 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            -5 \amp = -9 + b 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            4 \amp = b 
          </mrow>
        </md>
        With the intercept, I can write the equation of the line.
        <me>
          y = -3x + 4
        </me>
        I'll leave it up to you to check if I had used the other
        point, I would have calculated the same value for <m>b</m>. 
      </li>
    </ul></p>

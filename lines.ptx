    <title>Equations of Lines</title>
    <p>
      When we defined loci in <xref ref="section-analytic-geometry"
      />, we mentioned that the first and most common type of
      locus is a line. This section reviews some definitions and
      calculations for lines. This should be familiar material from
      your previous mathematical experience, but it is worth
      reviewing. 
    </p>
    <p>
      A line is the locus of any equation where the variables <m>x</m>
      and <m>y</m> show up multiplied by constants and then
      added to another constant.  Other than multiplication by a
      constant, no other operations are performed on the variables: no
      exponents, no roots, no functions, nothing else.  These
      equations, since they produce lines, are called linear
      equations. Here are some examples.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          y \amp = 7x - 9 
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          5y + 4x - 10 \amp = 0
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \frac{1}{5} y - \frac{2}{7} x - \frac{5}{17} \amp = 0 
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \sqrt{7}y \amp = \pi x + \frac{1}{\sqrt{19}}
        </mrow>
      </md>
      In all these equations, all we have done is multiplied each
      varaible by some constant and added an additional constant. By
      adding and subtracting terms, we can put some of the variables
      or the constant on the right or left side of the equation, as we
      see fit. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If we wanted a general form, then let the symbols <m>a_1</m>,
      <m>a_2</m> and<m>a_3</m> stand for constants. We could bring
      everything over to one side of the equation and write the
      general form of an equation of a line this way:
      <me>
        a_1 x + a_2 y + a_3 = 0 
      </me>.
      This is a reasonable general form. All lines can be described by
      an equation of this form. However, this is not the most
      intuitive form -- we get that form by considering slope.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsection-slope">
    <title>Slope</title>
    <p>
      Let's review the concept of slope. The slope of a straight line
      is a measure of its steepness. A large slope descrbes a steep
      line <mdash /> one that is quickly increasing. A small slope
      describes a shallow line <mdash /> one that is slowly
      increasing. A negative slope describes a decreasing line.
    </p>
    <p>
      A line with a slope of zero is a horizontal line: it does not
      increase or decrease at all. A vertical line has no slope at
      all. (It does <em>not</em> have an infinite slope <mdash /> the
      slope is simply undefined). 
    </p>
    <p>
      To calculate the slope, we take choose any two points on the
      line. We calculate the difference in the <m>y</m> coordinates
      and call this the <em>rise</em>: it measures how far up the line
      goes between the two points. Then we calculate the difference in
      the <m>x</m> coordinates and call this the <em>run</em>: it
      measures how far we move horizontally between the two points.
      The slope is the rise divided by the run. 
      <me>
        \text{Slope} = \frac{\text{Rise}}{\text{Run}}
      </me>
      An example of a slope calculation is shown in <xref
      ref="figure-slope" />.
      <figure xml:id="figure-slope">
        <caption>Slope of the Line <m>y = \frac{1}{2} x + 2</m></caption>
        <image width="90%" source="images/figure81"/>
      </figure>
    </p>
    <p>
      This method of calculation shows us again why veritcal lines
      have no slope. The <m>x</m> coordinates of any two points on a
      vertical line are the same, to the run would be zero. To
      calculate the slope would involve division by zero, which is not
      defined. Therefore, vertical lines have no slope. 
    </p>

    <title>Slope Intercept Form</title>
    <p>
      Now that we have defined slope, we can reviewi or introduce a
      common way of writing the equations of lines. Go back to the
      four example lines above; in each of these, I will re-arrange
      the equation so that <m>y</m> is along on the left side. 
      <md>
        <mrow>
          y \amp = 7x - 9 
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          y \amp = - \frac{4}{5} x + 2
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          y \amp = \frac{10}{7} x + \frac{25}{17} 
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          y \amp = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{7}} x + \frac{1}{\sqrt{19}\sqrt{7}}
        </mrow>
      </md>
      I can describe the general form we get by solving for <m>y</m>
      on the left. Let <m>m</m> and <m>b</m> be constants 
      (the choice of these letters if conventional and used in many
      places). Then all of these equations have this form:
      <me>
        y = mx + b 
      </me>
      In this form, the number <m>m</m> will always be the slope of
      the line. The number <m>b</m> will be the <m>y</m>-coordinate of
      the point where the line crosses the <m>y</m> axis; this is
      called the <m>y</m>-intercept. These two pieces of information
      are enough to completely determine the line. If we know where a
      line crosses the <m>y</m>-axis and we know how quickly is grows from
      that point (its slope), then we know everything about the line.
      <xref ref="figure-slope-intercept" /> shows
      an example to illustrate this slope-intercept form.
      <figure xml:id="figure-slope-intercept">
        <caption>Slope-Intercept Form </caption>
        <image width="90%" source="images/figure82"/>
      </figure>
    </p>
    <p>
      As we said above, a horizontal lines has a slope of zero. In
      slope-intercept form this is<m>m = 0</m>, so the equation of the
      line looks like
      <me>
        y = 0x + b = b 
      </me>.
      Horizontal lines have equations <m>y = b</m> for some constant.
      All we need to specify if the <m>y</m> coordinate. <m>y = 4</m>
      is the horizontal line where the <m>y</m>-coordinate is always
      <m>4</m>, and the <m>x</m>-coordinate can be anything
      whatsoever. <xref ref="figure-horizontal-lines" /> shows some
      horizontal lines. 
      <figure xml:id="figure-horizontal-lines">
        <caption>Horizontal Lines</caption>
        <image width="90%" source="images/figure83"/>
      </figure>
    </p>
    <p>
      We've said several times that a vertical line has no slope and
      cannot be expressed in slope-intercept form. However, the
      previous paragraph gives us a good idea of how to understand
      vertical lines. If a horizontal line is simply determined by its
      <m>y</m> coordinate, a vertical line is similarly determined by
      its <m>x</m> coordinate. Any line of the form <m>x = b</m> is a
      horizontal line. <m>x - -3</m> is the horizontal line of points
      with <m>x</m>-coordinate <m>-3</m> and any <m>y</m> coordinate
      whatsoever. <xref ref="figure-vertical-lines" /> shows some
      horizontal lines.

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-calculating-lines">
    <title>Calcluating Equations of Lines</title>
    <p>
      We often need to calculate the equation of a line given various
      pieces of information about this line. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If we are give the slope and the <m>y</m>-intercept, we just
        put those numbers directly into the slope-intercept form. For
        example, if we wanted the line with slope <m>\frac{-2}{5}</m>
        and <m>y</m>-intercept <m>3</m>, we would simply put those
        numbers into the form and get the equation of the line:
        <me>
          y = \frac{-2}{5} x + 3 
        </me>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sometimes we are given a point and a slope. For example, say
        we wanted the equation of the line with slope <m>4</m> that
        goes through the point <m>(2,2)</m>. We have the slope, so we
        can put that in place of <m>m</m> in the slope intercept form.
        <me>
          y = 4x + b 
        </me>
        The <m>y</m>-intercept is still unknown. However, if we put in
        the point, we can solve for <m>b</m>.
        <md>
          <mrow>
            y \amp = 4x + b 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            2 \amp = (4)(2) + b 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            2 \amp = 8 + b 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            -6 \amp = b 
          </mrow>
        </md>
        That gives us a value for the <m>y</m>-intercept, hence the
        equation of the line.
        <me>
          y = 4x - 6 
        </me>
        This process works for any line give a slope and a point: put
        the slope into the slope-intercept form, put the point in for
        the coordinates <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, and solve for the
        intercept. 
      </li>
      <li>
        There is one last way of describing a line: by giving two
        points. There is a unique line passing between any two points
        <mdash /> but how do we get the equation of this line? We
        calculate the slope. Recall that slope is defined as the
        fraction rise over run. Rise is the difference in the <m>y</m>
        coordinates and run is the difference in the <m>x</m>
        coordinates, so given two points we can calculate the slope.
        I'll show this by example: what is the line through the point
        <m>(3,-5)</m> and <m>(1,1)</m>? First I'll calculate the
        slope.
        <me>
          m = \frac{\text{Rise}}{\text{Run}} = \frac{-5 - 1}{3 - 1} =
          \frac{-6}{2} = -3
        </me>
        The slope is <m>-3</m>, so the slope intercept looks like
        <me>
          y = -3x + b 
        </me>.
        Then the process is the same as the previous case: we have the
        slope and we have a point (two, in fact). We put in a point
        (either point will work) to calculate the intercept.
        <md>
          <mrow>
            y \amp = -3x + b 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            -5 \amp = (-3)(3) + b 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            -5 \amp = -9 + b 
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            4 \amp = b 
          </mrow>
        </md>
        With the intercept, we can write the equation of the line.
        <me>
          y = -3x + 4
        </me>
        I'll leave it up to you to check that if I had used the other
        point, I would have calculated the same value for <m>b</m>. 
      </li>

    <title>Limit Definitions</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="section-differential-equations" />, I said that
      algebra had a hard time with growth rates. Inside the tools of
      algebra, we don't have the ability to calculate this thing we
      called a derivative. We need a new tool. That new tool is
      something called a limit. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Algebra can give approximate answers of a variety of questions
      like the question of growth rate. It can build an approximation
      process.  Calculus starts by asking if we can somehow calculate
      the end of the approximation processs. Is there an exact answer
      at the end of all the approximation?  A limit is a way of
      understanding an infinite process and asking where the process
      eventually leads. The limit is the key new tool that transcends
      algebra and creates calculus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our definition of limits will be restricted to limits of
      functions. In a limit, we are comparing the input and output of
      a function during an approximation process. The process starts
      with moving the input towards a specific value and observing
      what happens to the output.

    <p>
      Let <m>f(x)</m> be a function and <m>a</m> a point either in the
      domain of the function or on the boundary of its domain. Then
      the statement
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = L
      </me>
      means that as <m>x</m> (the input) gets closer and closer to
      <m>a</m>, f(x) (the output) gets closer and closer to <m>L</m>.
      If such an <m>L</m> exists, we say the limit of <m>f(x)</m>
      exists at <m>x=a</m>; we also say that the limit converges.
      Otherwise we say the limit diverges.

      There are several ways in which the limit can diverge. The
      statement
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = \infty
      </me>
      means that as <m>x</m> gets closer and to <m>a</m>, the function
      value <m>f(x)</m> gets larger and larger without bound. The
      statement
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = -\infty
      </me>
      means that as <m>x</m> gets closer and to <m>a</m>, the function
      value <m>f(x)</m> becomes a larger and larger negative value
      without bound. The statement
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) \hspace{1cm} \text{ DNE }
      </me>
      means that the limit does not exist; it doesn't approach any
      number at all.

    <title>Vertical Asymptotes</title>
    <p>
      For limits which approach <m>\pm \infty</m>, we see that the
      graph of the function approaches a verticle line. These lines
      are called <em>vertical asymptotes</em> for the functions.
      Vertical asymptotes are shown as the dotted lines in the <xref
      ref="figure-three-divergent-limits" />.

    <p>
      In the above definitions, we assume that <m>x \rightarrow a</m>
      means <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m> from both sides, considering
      <m>x</m> slightly larger and <m>x</m> slightly smaller than
      <m>a</m>. Sometimes it is convenient to only use one side.
      These are called one sided limits. If we want to approach from
      the left (from <m>x</m> slightly smaller than <m>a</m>), we
      adjust the limit notation slightly by writing <m>a^-</m>.

      If we want to approach from the right (from <m>x</m> slightly
      larger than <m>a</m>), we write <m>a^+</m>.

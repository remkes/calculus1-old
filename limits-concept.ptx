    <p>
      In the prevous section, the two motivating problems of velocity
      and distance-travelled led us to approximation processes.
      Inside the field of algebra, we couldn't get exact answers to
      these problems, only approximate answers. However, algebra
      found a process for refining the approximation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calculus starts by asking if we can somehow calculate the end of
      an approximation processs. Is there an exact answer at the end
      of all the approximation? Calclulus uses a new tool, the limit,
      to find such an exact answer. A limit is a way of understanding
      an infinite process and asking where the process eventually
      leads. The limit is the key new tool that transcends algebra
      and creates calculus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our definition of limits will be restricted to limits of
      functions. In a limit, we are comparing the input and output of
      a function during an approximation process. The process starts
      with moving the input towards a specific value and observing
      what happens to the output.

      Let <m>f(x)</m> be a function and <m>a</m> a point either in the
      domain of the function or on the boundary of its domain. Then
      the statement
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = L
      </me>
      means that as <m>x</m> (the input) gets closer and closer to
      <m>a</m>, f(x) (the output) gets closer and closer to <m>L</m>.
      If such an <m>L</m> exists, we say the limit of <m>f(x)</m>
      exists at <m>x=a</m>; we also say that the limit converges.
      Otherwise we say the limit diverges.

    <p>
      There are several ways in which the limit can diverge. The
      statement
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = \infty
      </me>
      means that as <m>x</m> gets closer and to <m>a</m>, the function
      value <m>f(x)</m> gets larger and larger without bound. The
      statement
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = -\infty
      </me>
      means that as <m>x</m> gets closer and to <m>a</m>, the function
      value <m>f(x)</m> becomes a larger and larger negative value
      without bound. The statement
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) \hspace{1cm} \text{ DNE }
      </me>
      means that the limit does not exist; it doesn't approach any
      number at all.

    <title>Vertical Asymptotes</title>
    <p>
      For limits which approach <m>\pm \infty</m>, we see that the
      graph of the function approaches a verticle line. These lines
      are called <em>vertical asymptotes</em> for the functions.
      Vertical asymptotes are shown as the dotted lines in the <xref
      ref="figure-three-divergent-limits" />.

    <title>One-Sided Limits</title>
    <p>
      In the above definitions, we assume that <m>x \rightarrow a</m>
      means <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m> from both sides, considering
      <m>x</m> slightly larger and <m>x</m> slightly smaller than
      <m>a</m>. Sometimes it is convenient to only use one side.
      These are called one sided limits. If we want to approach from
      the left (from <m>x</m> slightly smaller than <m>a</m>), we
      adjust the limit notation slightly by writing <m>a^-</m>.
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a^-} f(x)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      If we want to approach from the right (from <m>x</m> slightly
      larger than <m>a</m>), we write <m>a^+</m>.
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a^+} f(x)
      </me>

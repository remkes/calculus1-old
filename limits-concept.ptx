    <title>Limit Definitions</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="section-differential-equations" />, I said that
      algebra had a hard time with growth rates. The tools of algebrae
      don't have the ability to calculate this thing I called a
      derivative. I need a new mathematical tool. That new tool is
      something called a limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Algebra can give approximate answers to a variety of questions
      like the question of growth rate. It can build an approximation
      process.  Calculus starts by asking how to somehow calculate
      the end of the approximation processs. Is there an exact answer
      at the end of all the approximation? A limit is a way of
      understanding an infinite process and asking where the process
      eventually leads. The limit is the key new tool that transcends
      algebra and creates calculus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The definition of limits will be restricted to limits of
      functions. In a limit, I want to compare the input and output of
      a function during an approximation process. The process starts
      by moving the input towards a specific value and then observing
      what happens to the output.

      Let <m>f(x)</m> be a function and <m>a</m> a point either in the
      domain of the function or on the edge of its domain. Then
      the statement
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = L
      </me>
      means that as <m>x</m> (the input) gets closer and closer to
      <m>a</m>, f(x) (the output) gets closer and closer to <m>L</m>.
      If such an <m>L</m> exists, it is called limit of <m>f(x)</m>
      at <m>x=a</m>. I can also simply say that the limit at
      <m>x=a</m> converges. If no such <m>L</m> exists, the limit
      diverges.

      There are several ways in which the limit can diverge. The
      statement
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = \infty
      </me>
      means that as <m>x</m> gets closer and to <m>a</m>, the function
      value <m>f(x)</m> gets larger and larger without bound. This is
      a divergent limit, since <m>\infty</m> is not a number.
      <m>\infty</m> is just a convenient shorthard for <sq>larger and
      larger without bound</sq>. Similarly, the statement
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = -\infty
      </me>
      means that as <m>x</m> gets closer and to <m>a</m>, the function
      value <m>f(x)</m> becomes a larger and larger negative value
      without bound. Finally, the statement
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) \hspace{1cm} \text{ DNE }
      </me>
      means that the limit does not exist; it doesn't approach any
      number at all. DNE stands for <sq>does not exist</sq>.

    <title>Vertical Asymptotes</title>
    <p>
      For limits which approach <m>\pm \infty</m>, the
      graph of the function approaches a verticle line. These lines
      are called <term>vertical asymptotes</term> for the functions.
      Vertical asymptotes are shown as the dotted lines in the <xref
      ref="figure-three-divergent-limits" />.

    <title>One-Sided Limits</title>
    <p>
      In the above definitions, I assumed that <m>x \rightarrow a</m>
      means <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m> from both sides, considering
      <m>x</m> slightly larger and <m>x</m> slightly smaller than
      <m>a</m>. Sometimes it is convenient to only use one side.
      These are called one sided limits. If I want to approach from
      the left (from <m>x</m> slightly smaller than <m>a</m>), I
      adjust the limit notation slightly by writing <m>a^-</m>.
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a^-} f(x)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      If I want to approach from the right (from <m>x</m> slightly
      larger than <m>a</m>), I write <m>a^+</m>.
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a^+} f(x)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that that the notation <m>a^{-1}</m> is <em>not</em>
      <m>-a</m>. If I write <m>\lim_{x \rightarrow 8^{-1}}</m>, I am
      interested the behaviour for numbers very slightly smaller than
      <m>8</m>: for <m>7.9</m>, <m>7.99</m>, <m>7.999</m>, and so on.
      I am not at all interesting in anything near <m>-8</m>.
